AB  - Previous studies have reported that intravenous drug users (IVDUs) have made considerable drug-use risk reduction, but less sexual risk reduction. This paper presents findings about sexual risk reduction by street-recruited IVDUs in New York City, and examines the predictors of sexual risk reduction. Sixty-one per cent of these street-recruited IVDUs have initiated deliberate sexual risk reduction in order to avoid AIDS. For the total sample (n = 568), as well as for the male IVDUs, specific health belief and social influence factors were significant predictors of sexual risk reduction. For female IVDUs, drug-risk reduction, having a friend or acquaintance who practices sexual risk reduction, and wanting to have a(nother) child were significant predictors of sexual risk reduction. These findings suggest the importance of social support and community organization to promote risk reduction.

AB  - BACKGROUND: HIV-1 entry into cells is a multifaceted process involving target cell CD4 and the chemokine receptors, CXCR4 or CCR5. The lipid composition of the host cell plays a significant role in the HIV fusion process as it orchestrates the appropriate disposition of CD4 and co-receptors required for HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env)-mediated fusion. The cell membrane is primarily composed of sphingolipids and cholesterol. The effects of lipid modulation on CD4 disposition in the membrane and their role in HIV-1 entry have extensively been studied. To focus on the role of lipid composition on chemokine receptor function, we have by-passed the CD4 requirement for HIV-1 Env-mediated fusion by using a CD4-independent strain of HIV-1 Env. RESULTS: Cell fusion mediated by a CD4-independent strain of HIV-1 Env was monitored by observing dye transfer between Env-expressing cells and NIH3T3 cells bearing CXCR4 or CCR5 in the presence or absence of CD4. Chemokine receptor signaling was assessed by monitoring changes in intracellular [Ca2+] mobilization induced by CCR5 or CXCR4 ligand. To modulate target membrane cholesterol or sphingolipids we used Methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MbetaCD) or 1-phenyl-2-hexadecanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (PPMP), respectively. Treatment of the target cells with these agents did not change the levels of CD4 or CXCR4, but reduced levels of CCR5 on the cell surface. Chemokine receptor signalling was inhibited by cholesterol removal but not by treatment with PPMP. HIV-1 Env mediated fusion was inhibited by >50% by cholesterol removal. Overall, PPMP treatment appeared to slow down the rates of CD4-independent HIV-1 Env-mediated Fusion. However, in the case of CXCR4-dependent fusion, the differences between untreated and PPMP-treated cells did not appear to be significant. CONCLUSION: Although modulation of cholesterol and sphingolipids has similar effects on CD4-dependent HIV-1 Env-mediated fusion, sphingolipid modulation had little effect on CD4-independent HIV-1 Env-mediated fusion. Chemokine receptor function remained intact following treatment of cells with PPMP. Therefore such treatment may be considered a more suitable agent to inhibit CD4 dependent HIV-1 infection.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To present and update available national and subnational estimates of injecting drug users (IDUs) in developing/transitional countries, and provide indicative estimates of gender and age distribution. METHODS: Literature review of both grey and published literature including updates from previously reported estimates on estimates of IDU population and data sources giving age and gender breakdowns. The scope area was developing/transitional countries and the reference period was 1998-2005. RESULTS: Estimates of IDU numbers were available in 105 countries and 243 subnational areas. The largest IDU populations were reported from Brazil, China, India, and Russia (0.8 m, 1.9 m, 1.1 m, and 1.6 m respectively). Subnational areas with the largest IDU populations (35,000-79,000) are: Warsaw (Poland); Barnadul, Irtkustk, Nizhny-Novgorod, Penza, Voronez, St Petersburg, and Volgograd (Russia); New Delhi and Mumbai (India); Jakarta (Indonesia), and Bangkok (Thailand). By region, Eastern Europe and Central Asia have the largest IDU prevalence (median 0.65%) (min 0.3%; max 2.2%; Q1 0.39%; Q3 1.32%) [corrected] followed by Asia and Pacific: 0.24% (min 0.004%; max 1.47%; Q1 0.14%; Q3 1.47%) [corrected] In the Middle East and Africa the median value equals 0.2% (min 0.0003%; max 0.35%; Q1 0.11%; Q3 0.23%) [corrected] and in Latin America and the Caribbean: 0.12% (min 0.11%; max 0.69%; Q1 0.04%; Q3 0.13%) [corrected] Subnational areas with the highest IDU prevalence among adults (8-14.9%) were Shymkent (Kazakhstan), Balti (Moldova), Astrakhan, Barnadul, Irtkustk, Khabarovsk, Kaliningrad, Naberezhnyje Chelny, Penza, Togliatti, Volgograd, Voronez, and Yaroslavl (Russia), Dushanbe (Tajikistan), Ashgabad (Turkmenistan), Ivano-Frankivsk and Pavlograd (Ukraine) and Imphal, Manipur (India). 66% (297/447) of the IDU estimates were reported without technical information. Data on the IDU age/gender distributions are also scarce or unavailable for many countries. In 11 Eastern European and Central Asian countries the age group <or=20-29 represented >50% of the total. The proportion of IDU men was 70%-90% in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, and there was a marked absence of data on women outside this region. CONCLUSION: Unfortunately data on IDU prevalence available to national and international policymakers is of an unknown and probably yet to be tested quality. This study provide baseline figures but steps need to be taken now to improve the reporting and assessment of these critical data.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the effectiveness of various preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) prescription strategies for African-American women impacted by mass incarceration within an urban setting. DESIGN: An agent-based model was utilized to evaluate prevention strategies in an efficient, ethical manner. By defining agents, their characteristics and relationships, we assessed population-level effects of PrEP on HIV incidence. METHODS: We tested hypothetical PrEP prescription strategies within a simulation representing the African-American population of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Four strategies were evaluated: PrEP for women meeting CDC indicators regarding partner characteristics, PrEP for women with a recently incarcerated male partner, PrEP for women with a recently released male partner and couples-based PrEP at time of release. Interventions occurred alongside scale-up of HAART. We evaluated reductions in HIV transmissions, the number of persons on PrEP needed to avert one HIV transmission (NNT) and the resulting proportions of people on PrEP. RESULTS: Scenarios prescribing PrEP based on criminal justice system involvement reduced HIV transmissions. The NNT ranged from 147 (couples-based scenario) to 300 (recently released scenario). The percentage of the female population covered by PrEP at any one time ranged from 0.14% (couples-based) to 10.8% (CDC-based). CDC-guideline scenarios were consistently less efficient compared to the justice-involved interventions. CONCLUSION: Expanding PrEP for African-American women and their male partners affected by incarceration should be considered in national HIV prevention goals and correctional facilities leveraged as intervention sites. Partner characteristics in the current CDC indications may be more effective and efficient if guidelines considered criminal justice involvement.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The United States has the highest incarceration rate in the world. Incarceration can increase HIV risk behaviors for individuals involved with the criminal justice system and may be a driver of HIV acquisition within the community. METHODS: We used an agent-based model to simulate HIV transmission in a sexual-contact network representing heterosexual African American men and women in Philadelphia to identify factors influencing the impact of male mass incarceration on HIV acquisition in women. The model was calibrated using surveillance data and assumed incarceration increased the number of sexual contacts and decreased HIV care engagement for men post-release. Incarceration of a partner increased the number of sexual contacts for women. We compared a counterfactual scenario with no incarceration to scenarios varying key parameters to determine what factors drove HIV acquisition in women. RESULTS: Setting the duration of male high-risk sexual behavior to two years post-release increased the number of HIV transmissions to women by more than 20%. Decreasing post-release HIV care engagement and increasing HIV acquisition risk attributable to sexually transmitted infections (STIs) also increased the number of HIV transmissions to women. Changing the duration of risk behavior for women, the proportion of women engaging in higher risk behavior, and the relative risk of incarceration for HIV-infected men had minimal impact. CONCLUSION: The mass incarceration of African American men can increase HIV acquisition in African American women on a population-level through factors including post-release high-risk behaviors, disruption of HIV care engagement among formerly incarcerated men, and increased STI prevalence. These findings suggest that the most influential points of intervention may be programs seeking to reduce male risk behaviors and promote HIV care engagement post-release, as well as STI testing and treatment programs for recently incarcerated men, as well as women with incarcerated partners.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Incarceration and HIV disproportionately impact African American communities. The mass incarceration of African American men is hypothesized to increase HIV acquisition risk for African American women. Interventions optimizing HIV care engagement and minimizing sexual risk behaviors for men living with HIV post-incarceration may decrease HIV incidence. METHODS: Using an agent-based model, we simulated a sexual and injection drug using network representing the African American population of Philadelphia. We compared intervention strategies for men living with HIV post-incarceration by the number of averted HIV transmissions to women within the community. Three interventions were evaluated: a 90-90-90 scenario scaling up HIV testing, ART provision, and ART adherence; a behavioral intervention decreasing sexual risk behaviors; and a combination intervention involving both. RESULTS: The status quo scenario projected 2,836 HIV transmissions to women over twenty years. HIV transmissions to women decreased by 29% with the 90-90-90 intervention, 23% with the behavioral intervention, and 37% with both. The number of men living with HIV receiving the intervention needed in order to prevent a single HIV transmission ranged between 6 and 10. CONCLUSION: Interventions to improve care engagement and decrease sexual risk behaviors post-incarceration for men living with HIV have the potential to decrease HIV incidence within African American heterosexual networks.

AB  - Control over the simultaneous delivery of different functionalities and their synchronized intracellular activation can greatly benefit the fields of RNA and DNA biomedical nanotechnologies and allow for the production of nanoparticles and various switching devices with controllable functions. We present a system of multiple split functionalities embedded in the cognate pairs of RNA-DNA hybrids which are programmed to recognize each other, re-associate and form a DNA duplex while also releasing the split RNA fragments which upon association regain their original functions. Simultaneous activation of three different functionalities (RNAi, Förster resonance energy transfer and RNA aptamer) confirmed by multiple in vitro and cell culture experiments prove the concept. To automate the design process, a novel computational tool that differentiates between the thermodynamic stabilities of RNA-RNA, RNA-DNA and DNA-DNA duplexes was developed. Moreover, here we demonstrate that besides being easily produced by annealing synthetic RNAs and DNAs, the individual hybrids carrying longer RNAs can be produced by RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription of single-stranded DNA templates.

AB  - Split-protein systems, an approach that relies on fragmentation of proteins with their further conditional re-association to form functional complexes, are increasingly used for various biomedical applications. This approach offers tight control of protein functions and improved detection sensitivity. Here we report a similar technique based on a pair of RNA-DNA hybrids that can be used generally for triggering different split functionalities. Individually, each hybrid is inactive but when two cognate hybrids re-associate, different functionalities are triggered inside mammalian cells. As a proof of concept, this work mainly focuses on the activation of RNA interference. However, the release of other functionalities (such as resonance energy transfer and RNA aptamer) is also shown. Furthermore, in vivo studies demonstrate a significant uptake of the hybrids by tumours together with specific gene silencing. This split-functionality approach presents a new route in the development of 'smart' nucleic acid-based nanoparticles and switches for various biomedical applications.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To investigate the associated factors and treatment outcomes in patients with presumed noninfectious endophthalmitis after intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide (IVTA) injection. METHODS: Among 219 consecutive cases of 186 patients who had undergone IVTA injection for macular diseases, presumed noninfectious endophthalmitis was diagnosed if the patient showed severe inflammation in the anterior chamber and vitreous cavity within 7 days after injection but no organism was isolated on microbiological examination. Clinical features and previously performed surgical procedures were evaluated to assess their association with presumed noninfectious endophthalmitis using logistic regression. After surgical or medical treatment for endophthalmitis, the visual outcome was evaluated in all patients. RESULTS: Noninfectious endophthalmitis developed in six of 219 eyes (2.7 %). Previous vitrectomy, history of IVTA injection, and pseudophakia were significantly associated with the occurrence of presumed noninfectious endophthalmitis after IVTA injection (p = 0.049, 0.034, and 0.009, respectively). Internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling during vitrectomy also showed statistically significant association (odds ratio = 13.6, p = 0.017). Five of six patients (83.3 %) regained pre-injection vision. CONCLUSION: In addition to previous vitrectomy, history of IVTA injection, internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling, and pseudophakia may render the eye vulnerable to presumed noninfectious endophthalmitis following IVTA injection. Visual outcome shows generally good prognosis after treatment.

AB  - Our objective was to determine tuberculosis (TB) incidence and evaluate TB risk in adults after one or more years of use of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) through a retrospective cohort study in Jos, Nigeria. We studied a cohort of HIV-infected adults treated with ART for at least 1 year. Based on immunologic and virologic responses to ART, patients were categorized into four groups: CD4 T cell count ≥350 cells/mm(3) and HIV-1 RNA level ≤400 copies/ml (group 1), CD4 T cell count ≥350 cells/mm(3) and HIV-1 RNA level >400 copies/ml (group 2), CD4 T cell count <350 cells/mm(3) and HIV-1 RNA level ≤400 copies/ml (group 3), and CD4 T cell count <350 cells/mm(3) and HIV-1 RNA level >400 copies/ml (group 4). Time to incident TB for the four groups was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox regression models were used to evaluate predictors of incident TB. In this cohort of 5,093 HIV-infected adults, of which 68.4% were female, with a mean age 35.1 years (standard deviation 9.1 years), we observed 98 cases of incident TB during 4 years and 3 months of follow-up. The overall TB incidence rate was 8.7 cases/1,000 patient-years of follow-up. Adjusted hazards for incident TB were 2.11 (95% CI 0.97-4.61), 2.05 (95% CI 1.10-3.79), and 3.65 (95% CI 1.15-5.06) in group 2, 3, and 4 patients, respectively, compared to group 1. Tuberculosis incidence in patients on ART is driven by poor immunologic and/or virologic response. Optimization of HIV treatment should be prioritized to reduce the burden of TB in this high-risk population.

AB  - The dinucleotide CpG is highly underrepresented in the genome of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). To identify the source of CpG depletion in the HIV-1 genome, we investigated two biological mechanisms: (1) CpG methylation-induced transcriptional silencing and (2) CpG recognition by Toll-like receptors (TLRs). We hypothesized that HIV-1 has been under selective evolutionary pressure by these mechanisms leading to the reduction of CpG in its genome. A CpG depleted genome would enable HIV-1 to avoid methylation-induced transcriptional silencing and/or to avoid recognition by TLRs that identify foreign CpG sequences. We investigated these two hypotheses by determining the sequence context dependency of CpG depletion and comparing it with that of CpG methylation and TLR recognition. We found that in both human and HIV-1 genomes the CpG motifs flanked by T/A were depleted most and those flanked by C/G were depleted least. Similarly, our analyses of human methylome data revealed that the CpG motifs flanked by T/A were methylated most and those flanked by C/G were methylated least. Given that a similar CpG depletion pattern was observed for the human genome within which CpGs are not likely to be recognized by TLRs, we argue that the main source of CpG depletion in HIV-1 is likely host-induced methylation. Analyses of CpG motifs in over 100 viruses revealed that this unique CpG representation pattern is specific to the human and simian immunodeficiency viruses.

AB  - People who inject drugs (PWID) play a critical role in injection-naïve individuals transitioning to injection drug use. We investigated factors associated with future likelihood of initiating injection-naïve individuals using multivariable logistic regression among 418 PWID in rural Appalachia (Cabell County, West Virginia). Less than 10% reported they were likely to initiate someone in the future. Acquiring syringes from a syringe services program was associated with decreased odds of being likely to initiate someone in the future (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.46, 95% CI 0.23, 0.95), while having previously initiated someone into injection drug use was associated with increased odds (aOR 8.65, 95% CI 4.07, 18.41). Among our sample of PWID in Appalachia, a small proportion reported that they would be likely to initiate an injection-naïve individual in the future. Efforts to reduce injection initiation assistance should focus on this subpopulation of PWID who indicate a willingness to engage in this behavior.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Upwards of 35% of young gay and bisexual men living with HIV report daily use of cannabis in the U.S. The effects of legalisation of recreational and medical cannabis on the acquisition of cannabis products amongst a group with such high prevalence of use is largely unknown. METHODS: We investigated potential effects of recent legalisation and changes in distribution venues/networks in U.S. jurisdictions (Denver and Chicago) with different legal statuses regarding medical and recreational cannabis. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 30 young gay and bisexual men living with HIV recruited from adolescent HIV clinics and service sites in the two cities. RESULTS: Findings indicate four domains in which the acquisition of cannabis from medical or recreational dispensaries was differentiated by participants from acquisition from illicit drug distribution networks: quality of information, perceived quality of products, safety of acquisition, and safety of products. Some participants expressed reservations in becoming involved with requirements for accessing legal distribution of medical and recreational cannabis. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that young men living with HIV in Denver perceive benefits from legalisation of cannabis in terms of quality of information and products and safety of acquisition for a range of medical, therapeutic, and recreational uses. Participants in Chicago report mixed levels of knowledge of potential benefits through the medical cannabis dispensaries in their area, and continue to be exposed to safety risks associated with street-based acquisition. Concerns regarding institutional involvement in medical cannabis registries and dispensaries may inhibit the uptake of legal means of acquisition in sub-populations of young men living with HIV.

AB  - The objectives of this study were to: (1) describe the quantity and quality of social support networks of Latino immigrants living in a new receiving environment, and (2) determine the role such networks play in their HIV/STI risk behaviors, including substance use. Double incentivized convenience sampling was used to collect egocentric social support network data on 144 Latino immigrants. Latent class analysis was used for data reduction and to identify items best suited to measure quality and quantity of social support. Moderate and high quantity and quality of social support were protective of HIV/STI sexual risk behavior compared to low quantity and quality of support, after adjustment for gender, years in New Orleans and residing with family. Neither measure of social support was associated with binge drinking. The findings suggest that increased quantity and quality of social support decrease HIV/STI sexual risk behaviors but do not influence binge drinking. Interventions that improve the quantity and quality of social support are needed for Latino immigrants.

AB  - This study assesses whether injection risk behaviors (e.g., syringe sharing and sharing injection paraphernalia) can be understood using a model that highlights drug related peer beliefs and role strain/deprivation. Data were collected on 561 Puerto Rican injection drug users in New York and 313 in Puerto Rico. A drug peer beliefs scale and three indicators of role strain were used with other control variables in a hierarchical multiple logistic regression model. Both aspects of the model were significant predictors of HIV risk behaviors in New York, but only role strain was a significant predictor for injection drug users (IDUs) in Puerto Rico. Individual-based paradigms should incorporate peer beliefs and role strain/deprivation in order to reduce HIV risk behaviors.

AB  - This article investigates the association between residential status and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) risk behaviors among island and New York Puerto Rican injection drug users (IDUs). We assigned 561 subjects from New York City and 312 from Puerto Rico to five residential status categories: living in parent's home, living in own home, living in other's home, living in temporary housing (hotel, single-room occupancy [SRO] hotels), and homeless (living in streets/shelters). Dependent variables included injection- and sex-related risk behaviors (sharing syringes, sharing other injection paraphernalia, shooting gallery use, and having paid sex). Chi square, t tests, and multivariate logistic analysis tests were performed separately by site. About one-quarter of the sample in each site was homeless. Island Puerto Ricans were more likely to live with their parents (44% vs. 12%, p < .001), and more New York IDUs lived in their own home (30% vs. 14%, p < .001). In New York, gallery use and paid sex were associated with living in other's home, living in parent's home, and being homeless. Sharing paraphernalia was related to living in other's home, living in temporary housing, and being homeless. In Puerto Rico, having paid sex was associated with homelessness. High-risk behaviors were more likely among homeless IDUs in both sites. Programs to provide housing and target outreach and other prevention programs for homeless IDUs would be helpful in reducing HIV risk.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate and report cases of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission through donor artificial insemination (AI) before 1986 at five infertility clinics. DESIGN: Two types of look-back studies were performed: (1) identification of an HIV-infected woman who reported previous AI, followed by identification of the infected donor(s) and contact tracing of women who were inseminated with his semen, and (2) identification of an HIV-infected donor and subsequent examination of women receiving AI procedures using his semen. SETTING: Five infertility clinics in Los Angeles County, California; San Diego County, California; Arizona; and Vancouver, British Columbia. PATIENTS: A total of 230 women were inseminated with semen from any one of the five identified HIV-infected donors; 199 (87%) consented to HIV testing. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Seropositivity for HIV among AI recipients. RESULTS: Seven (3.52%) of the 199 women (95% confidence interval, 1.55% to 7.41%) who were artificially inseminated with semen from any of five HIV-infected donors and consented to HIV testing tested HIV-seropositive. Information on HIV risk was available for three of the five donors; all three reported a history of having sex with men. Four HIV-infected women were identified through uncommon circumstances, rather than through routine look-back studies of donors. CONCLUSION: Infection with HIV through donor AI performed before routine HIV screening of semen donors represents a potentially serious threat to women who underwent AI procedures. Public health policies requiring retrospective identification of HIV-infected semen donors and patients receiving AI before 1986, especially in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-prevalent areas, should be considered routine. Women diagnosed with AIDS or HIV infection, in whom no identified risk of HIV acquisition is established, should be questioned about previous AI procedures.

AB  - Altered T cell profiles have been linked with metrics of persistent cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections in healthy aging and older HIV patients stable on antiretroviral therapy (ART). In this study, we use CMV DNA to identify active infections, and levels of CMV-reactive antibody to assess the persistent burden of CMV in a longitudinal study of 78 young adult patients beginning ART in Jakarta, Indonesia, with <200 CD4 T cells/L. CMV antibodies, inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein [CRP], soluble interferon-alpha/beta receptor) and T cell phenotypes were assessed before ART (V0) and after 1, 3, 6, and 12 months (V1-V12). CMV DNA was detected in 41 patients (52%) at V0, irrespective of CD4 T cell counts, gender, age, or plasma HIV RNA. CMV DNA+ patients had higher levels of antibody reactive with CMV Immediate Early 1 (IE-1) at V0 and V12 (p = 0.04), and with CMV lysate at V12 (p = 0.01). Detectable CMV DNA did not align with inflammatory markers, but associated with lower CD4/CD8 ratios until V3. CMV antibody levels correlated inversely with proportions of naive CD4 and CD8 T cells, and directly with proportions of CD57(+) and activated memory T cells (CD3(+) CD45RA(-)) after 3-12 months on ART. Overall, active CMV replication is common in HIV patients beginning ART in Indonesia and associates with low CD4/CD8 ratios. Elevated levels of CMV-reactive antibody measured on ART also mark a depletion of naive T cells, accumulation of memory T cells, and may be a stable metric of the burden of CMV.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies report that among people who inject drugs (PWID), approximately 1 in 7 initiated injection during their thirties or later (referred to hereafter as "late initiates"). However, little is known about individuals who are late initiates. This study aims to describe characteristics of late initiates to drug injection and to examine how they differ from people who initiated drug injection prior to the age of 30 ("typical initiates"). METHODS: We recruited 696 active PWID in Los Angeles and San Francisco, California between 2011 and 2013, using targeted sampling and street outreach methods. Participants completed personal interviews that covered items on demographics, drug use history and practices, injection initiation episode, HIV injection- and sex-related risk, health care utilization among others. We used bivariate and multivariate analyses to examine factors associated being a late initiate. RESULTS: In our sample, 19% of participants who were 30 years or older were classified as late initiates. In multivariate analysis controlling for city, late initiates had higher odds of being female and African American, having been in treatment prior to initiation, initiating illicit drug use at an older age, and being assisted into injection by someone of the same age or younger. Late initiates had lower odds of frequent recent injection, and having a bipolar disorder diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Late initiates comprise a significant proportion of active PWIDs. More study on the health consequences of late initiation are needed as are interventions to prevent transition to drug injection among at-risk populations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has transformed how people seeking to reduce opioid use access treatment services and navigate efforts to abstain from using opioids. Social distancing policies have drastically reduced access to many forms of social support, but they may have also upended some perceived barriers to reducing or abstaining from opioid use. OBJECTIVE: This qualitative study aims to identify informal coping strategies for reducing and abstaining from opioid use among Reddit users who have posted in opioid-related subreddits at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We extracted data from 2 major opioid-related subreddits. Thematic data analysis was used to evaluate subreddit posts dated from March 5 to May 13, 2020, that referenced COVID-19 and opioid use, resulting in a final sample of 300 posts that were coded and analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 300 subreddit posts, 100 (33.3%) discussed at least 1 type of informal coping strategy. Those strategies included psychological and behavioral coping skills, adoption of healthy habits, and use of substances to manage withdrawal symptoms. In addition, 12 (4%) subreddit posts explicitly mentioned using social distancing as an opportunity for cessation of or reduction in opioid use. CONCLUSIONS: Reddit discussion forums have provided a community for people to share strategies for reducing opioid use and support others during the COVID-19 pandemic. Future research needs to assess the impact of COVID-19 on opioid use behaviors, especially during periods of limited treatment access and isolation, as these can inform future efforts in curbing the opioid epidemic and other substance-related harms.

AB  - Understanding the structural organization of lipids in the cell and viral membranes is essential for elucidating mechanisms of viral fusion that lead to entry of enveloped viruses into their host cells. The HIV lipidome shows a remarkable enrichment in dihydrosphingomyelin, an unusual sphingolipid formed by a dihydrosphingosine backbone. Here we investigated the ability of dihydrosphingosine to incorporate into the site of membrane fusion mediated by the HIV envelope (Env) protein. Dihydrosphingosine as well as cholesterol, fatty acid, and tocopherol was conjugated to highly conserved, short HIV-1 Env-derived peptides with no antiviral activity otherwise. We showed that dihydrosphingosine exclusively endowed nanomolar antiviral activity to the peptides (IC(50) as low as 120 nM) in HIV-1 infection on TZM-bl cells and on Jurkat T cells, as well as in the cell-cell fusion assay. These sphingopeptides were active against enfuvirtide-resistant and wild-type CXCR4 and CCR5 tropic HIV strains. The anti-HIV activity was determined by both the peptides and their dihydrosphingosine conjugate. Moreover, their mode of action involved accumulation in the cells and viruses and binding to membranes enriched in sphingomyelin and cholesterol. The data suggest that sphingopeptides are recruited to the HIV membrane fusion site and provide a general concept in developing inhibitors of sphingolipid-mediated biological systems.

AB  - Fusion of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) with target cells is mediated by the gp41 transmembrane envelope protein. The loop region within gp41 contains 2 crucial cysteines that play an unknown role in HIV-cell fusion. On the basis of cell-cell fusion assay, using human T-cell lines [Jurkat E6-1 and Jurkat HXBc2(4)], and virus-cell fusion assay, using fully infectious HIV-1 HXBc2 virus and TZM-bl human cell line, we provide evidence that the oxidation state of the disulfide bond within a loop domain peptide determines its activity. The oxidized (closed) form inhibits fusion, while the reduced (opened) form enhances hemifusion. These opposite activities reach 60% difference in viral fusion. Both forms of the loop domain interact with gp41: the opened form enhances gp41 folding into a bundle, whereas the closed form inhibits this folding. Therefore, the transformation of the cysteines from a reduced to an oxidized state enables the loop to convert from opened to closed conformations, which assists gp41 to fold and induces hemifusion. The significant conservation of the loop region within many envelope proteins suggests a general mechanism, which is exploited by viruses to enhance entry into their host cells.

AB  - High-dose methotrexate is used to treat a range of adult and childhood cancers including osteosarcoma. Significant neurotoxicity is reported in 1% to 4.5% of patients treated with high-dose methotrexate and can present in a wide variety of symptoms. We present a case of a 14-year-old boy with a recent diagnosis of osteosarcoma who presented to the emergency department with status epilepticus, altered mental status, and very high fever secondary to methotrexate neurotoxicity. We review current literature and discuss some controversies related to this state. We also describe high fever as one of the possible symptoms associated with this condition and suggest using specific magnetic resonance imaging sequence to uncover abnormal findings related to this state. Since high-dose methotrexate is not a rare treatment in this era, we believe that in addition to oncologists, emergency department and intensive care providers should be aware of the potential role of methotrexate in causing significant neurotoxicity and include it in the differential diagnosis when treating a patient presenting with new neurological symptoms in the setting of recent high-dose methotrexate treatment.

AB  - Lethally irradiated normal BALB/c mice, reconstituted with murine SCID bone marrow and engrafted with human PBMC (Trimera mice), were used to establish a novel murine model for HIV-1 infection. The Trimera mice were successfully infected with different clades and primary isolates of T- and M-tropic HIV-1, with the infection persisting in the animals for 4-6 wk. Rapid loss of the human CD4+ T cells, decrease in CD4/CD8 ratio, and increased T cell activation accompanied the viral infection. All HIV-1 infected animals were able to generate both primary and secondary immune responses, including HIV specific human humoral and cellular responses. In addition to testing the efficacy of new antiviral compounds, this new murine HIV-1 model may be used for studying host-virus interactions and, most importantly, for screening and developing potential HIV-1 protective vaccines and adjuvants (Ayash-Rashkovsky et al., http://www.fasebj.org/cgi/doi/10.1096/fj.04-3185fje; doi:10.1096/fj.04-3185fje.).

AB  - The antinociceptive effect and the mechanism of bee venom acupuncture (BVA) on inflammatory pain, especially in the rat model of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), have not yet been fully studied. This study was designed to investigate the antinociceptive effect and its mu-opioid and alpha2-adrenergic mechanism of BVA in the CIA rat model. To induce CIA, male Sprague-Dawley rats were immunized with bovine type II collagen emulsified in Freund's incomplete adjuvant followed by a booster injection 14 days later. The antinociceptive effect was evaluated by tail flick latency (TFL). After induction of arthritis, the inflammatory pain threshold decreased as time passed, and there was no big change of the pain threshold after 3 weeks. Three weeks after the first immunization, BVA (0.25 mg/kg) injected into the Zusanli acupoint (ST36) showed the antinociceptive effect. Furthermore, the antinociceptive effect of BVA was blocked by yohimbine (alpha2-adrenergic receptor antagonist, 2 mg/kg, i.p) pretreatment, but not by naloxone (mu-opioid receptor antagonist, 2 mg/kg, i.p.) pretreatment. These results suggest that BVA can relieve inflammatory pain in CIA and the antinociceptive effect of BVA can be mediated by alpha2-adrenergic receptor.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Growth hormone–releasing hormone(GHRH), growth hormone, and insulin like growth factor 1 have potent effects on brain function, their levels decrease with advancing age, and they likely play a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease. Previously, we reported favorable cognitive effects of short-term GHRH administration in healthy older adults and provided preliminary evidence to suggest a similar benefit in adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of GHRH on cognitive function in healthy older adults and in adults with MCI. DESIGN: Randomized,double-blind,placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: Clinical Research Center, University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 152 adults (66 with MCI) ranging in age from 55 to 87 years (mean age, 68 years); 137 adults (76 healthy participants and 61 participants with MCI) successfully completed the study. INTERVENTION: Participants self-administered daily subcutaneous injections of tesamorelin (Theratechnologies Inc),a stabilized analog of human GHRH (1 mg/d), or placebo 30 minutes before bedtime for 20 weeks. At baseline, at weeks 10 and 20 of treatment, and after a 10-week washout(week 30), blood samples were collected, and parallel versions of a cognitive battery were administered. Before and after the 20-week intervention, participants completed an oral glucose tolerance test and a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scan to measure body composition. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary cognitive outcomes were analyzed using analysis of variance and included 3 composites reflecting executive function, verbal memory, and visual memory. Executive function was assessed with Stroop Color-Word Interference,Task Switching, the Self-Ordered Pointing Test, and Word Fluency, verbal memory was assessed with Story Recall and the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test,and visual memory was assessed with the Visual-Spatial Learning Test and Delayed Match-to-Sample. RESULTS: The intent-to-treat analysis indicated a favorable effect of GHRH on cognition (P=.03), which was comparable in adults with MCI and healthy older adults.The completer analysis showed a similar pattern, with a more robust GHRH effect (P=.002). Subsequent analyses indicated a positive GHRH effect on executive function (P=.005) and a trend showing a similar treatment-related benefit in verbal memory(P=.08). Treatment with GHRH increased insulin like growth factor 1 levels by 117 %(P.001), which remained within the physiological range, and reduced percent body fat by 7.4%(P.001). Treatment with GHRH increased fasting insulin levels within the normal range by 35%in adults with MCI (P.001) but not in healthy adults. Adverse events were mild and were reported by 68%of GHRH treated adults and 36% of those who received placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Twenty weeks of GHRH administration had favorable effects on cognition in both adults with MCI and healthy older adults. Longer-duration treatment trials are needed to further examine the therapeutic potential of GHRH administration on brain health during normal aging and “pathological aging.” TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00257712

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The University of Chicago Medicine (UCM) led the Expanded Testing and Linkage to Care (X-TLC) program for disproportionately affected populations on the South Side of Chicago. The X-TLC program aimed to expand routine HIV testing to high-prevalence communities with disproportionately affected populations (i.e., minority men and women, men who have sex with men, and intravenous drug users) according to CDC guidelines at multiple clinical sites. METHODS: The X-TLC program used standard blood-based laboratory testing vs. point-of-care rapid testing or rapid laboratory testing with point-of-care results notification. Site coordinators and the linkage-to-care coordinator at UCM oversaw testing, test notification, and linkage to care. RESULTS: From February 1, 2011, through December 31, 2013, the X-TLC program completed 75,345 HIV tests on 67,153 unique patients. Of the total tests, 48,044 (63.8%) were performed on patients who self-identified as African American and 6,606 (8.8%) were performed on patients who self-identified as Hispanic. Of the 67,153 patients tested, 395 (0.6%) tested positive and 176 (0.3%) were previously unaware of their HIV-positive status. Seroprevalence was even higher for EDs, where 127 of 12,957 patients tested positive for HIV (1.0% seroprevalence), than for other patient care sites, including for new diagnoses, where 50 of 12,957 patients tested positive for HIV (0.4% seroprevalence). Of the 176 newly diagnosed patients, 166 of 173 (96.0%) patients who were still alive when testing was complete received their test results, and 148 of the 166 patients who were eligible for care (89.0%) were linked to care. Patients linked to X-TLC physicians did well with respect to the continuum of care: 77 of 123 (62.6%) patients achieved HIV viral load of <200 copies/milliliter. CONCLUSION: Lead organizations such as UCM were able to assist and oversee HIV screening and linkage to care for HIV patients diagnosed at community sites. HIV screening and linkage to care can be accomplished by incorporating standard testing for HIV into routine medical care.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: At least 500 000 people in the US experience homelessness nightly. More than 30% of people experiencing homelessness also have a substance use disorder. Involuntary displacement is a common practice in responding to unsheltered people experiencing homelessness. Understanding the health implications of displacement (eg, "sweeps," "clearings," "cleanups") is important, especially as they relate to key substance use disorder outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the long-term health effects of involuntary displacement of people experiencing homelessness who inject drugs in 23 US cities. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A closed cohort microsimulation model that simulates the natural history of injection drug use and health outcomes among people experiencing homelessness who inject drugs in 23 US cities. The model was populated with city-level data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National HIV Behavioral Surveillance system and published data to make representative cohorts of people experiencing homelessness who inject drugs in those cities. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Projected outcomes included overdose mortality, serious injection-related infections and mortality related to serious injection-related infections, hospitalizations, initiations of medications for opioid use disorder, and life-years lived over a 10-year period for 2 scenarios: "no displacement" and "continual involuntary displacement." The population-attributable fraction of continual displacement to mortality was estimated among this population. RESULTS: Models estimated between 974 and 2175 additional overdose deaths per 10 000 people experiencing homelessness at 10 years in scenarios in which people experiencing homelessness who inject drugs were continually involuntarily displaced compared with no displacement. Between 611 and 1360 additional people experiencing homelessness who inject drugs per 10 000 people were estimated to be hospitalized with continual involuntary displacement, and there will be an estimated 3140 to 8812 fewer initiations of medications for opioid use disorder per 10 000 people. Continual involuntary displacement may contribute to between 15.6% and 24.4% of additional deaths among unsheltered people experiencing homelessness who inject drugs over a 10-year period. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Involuntary displacement of people experiencing homelessness may substantially increase drug-related morbidity and mortality. These findings have implications for the practice of involuntary displacement, as well as policies such as access to housing and supportive services, that could mitigate these harms.

AB  - AIMS: To describe AIDS and malaria geography in Brazil, highlighting the role of injecting drug users (IDUs) in malaria outbreaks occurring in malaria-free regions, and the potential clinical and public health implications of malaria/HIV co-infection. DESIGN: Review of the available literature and original analyses using geoprocessing and spatial analysis techniques. FINDINGS: Both HIV/AIDS and malaria distribution are currently undergoing profound changes in Brazil, with mutual expansion to intersecting geographical regions and social networks. Very recent reports describe the first clinical case of AIDS in a remote Amazonian ethnic group, as well as malaria cases in Rio de Janeiro state (hitherto a malaria-free area for 20 years); in addition, two outbreaks of both infections occurred at the beginning of the 1990s in the most industrialized Brazilian state (São Paulo), due to the sharing of needles and syringes by drug users. Spatial data point to: (a) the expansion of HIV/AIDS towards malarigenic areas located in the centre-west and north of Brazil, along the main cocaine trafficking routes, with IDU networks apparently playing a core role; and (b) the possibility of new outbreaks of secondary malaria in urban settings where HIV/AIDS is still expanding, through the sharing of needles and syringes. CONCLUSIONS: New outbreaks of cases of HIV and malaria are likely to occur among Brazilian IDUs, and might conceivably contribute to the development of treatment-resistant strains of malaria in this population. Health professionals should be alert to this possibility, which could also eventually occur in IDU networks in developed countries.

AB  - At the time of surgery, occult metastases (micrometastases) are present in more than 50% of colorectal cancer patients, and the liver is the most frequent site of apparent metastatic disease. Frequently, adjuvant chemotherapy is unable to prevent tumor recurrence. Thus, novel therapeutic strategies are warranted. The aim of this study was to establish a model of human colon cancer metastatic to the liver of nude mice, to assess, in this setting, the therapeutic efficacy of radioimmunotherapy (RAIT) compared to standard chemotherapy and to evaluate, in a Phase I/II trial, the toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of RAIT in colorectal cancer patients with small volume disease metastatic to the liver. Multiple liver metastases of the human colon cancer cell line GW-39 were induced by intrasplenic injection of a 10% tumor cell suspension. Whereas controls were left untreated, therapy was initiated on day 10 or 20 after tumor inoculation with the 131I-labeled, low affinity anticarcinoembryonic antigen (anti-CEA) monoclonal antibody (MAb), F023C5 (Ka = 10(7) liters/mol), or the high-affinity anti-CEA MAb, MN-14 (Ka = 10(9) liters/mol), or chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil/leucovorin (folinic acid) versus irinotecan) at their respective maximum tolerated doses (MTDs). Twelve colorectal cancer patients with small volume disease metastatic to the liver (all lesions < or = 2.5 cm) were entered into a mCi/m2-based Phase I dose escalation study with 131I-labeled humanized version of MN-14, hMN-14. The patients were given single injections, starting at 50 mCi/m2 and escalating in 10-mCi/m2 increments. The MTD was defined as the dose level at which < or = 1 of 6 patients develop grade 4 myelotoxicity. In the mice, untreated controls died from rapidly progressing hepatic metastases at 6-8 weeks after tumor inoculation. The life span of mice treated with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin was prolonged for only 1-3 weeks, whereas irinotecan led to a 5-8-week prolongation. In contrast, at their respective MTDs, the 131I-labeled low-affinity anti-CEA MAb, F023C5, led to a 20% permanent cure rate, and the high affinity MAb, MN-14, led to an 80% permanent cure rate, when therapy was initiated at 10 days after tumor inoculation. In the 20-day-old tumor stage, although it prolonged life, 131I-F023C5 was unable to achieve cures, whereas 131I-MN-14 was still successful in 20%. Histologically, no remaining viable tumor cells could be demonstrated in these animals surviving > 6 months. In patients, the MTD was reached at 60 mCi/m2 of hMN-14 (at 70 mCi/m2, two of three grade 4 myelotoxicities). Of 11 assessable patients, 2 had partial remissions (corresponding to an objective response rate of 18%), and 5 (45%) had minor/mixed responses or experienced stabilization of previously rapidly progressing disease. These data suggest that in small volume disease, RAIT may be superior to conventional chemotherapy. Antibodies of higher affinity seem to be clearly superior. The clinical response rates in patients with small volume disease are encouraging, being comparable to the response rates of conventional chemotherapeutic regimens but with fewer side effects. Ongoing studies will show whether treatment at the MTD will further improve therapeutic results.

AB  - The renal uptake of radiolabeled antibody fragments and peptides is a problem in radioimmunodetection and radioimmunotherapy, especially with intracellular retained radiometals. The aim of this study was to develop suitable methods to reduce this kidney uptake. BALB/c mice or nude mice bearing the human GW-39 colon carcinoma xenograft were given i.p. injections of basic amino acids or a range of different basic amino acid derivatives, amino sugars, as well as cationic peptides. The effect of these agents on the biodistribution of Fab' and F(ab')2 fragments of different mAbs radiolabeled with 99mTc, 188Re, 111In, 88Y, or 125I was studied. Tumor and organ uptake was determined and compared to untreated mice. The kidney uptake of Fab' fragments was reduced 5-6-fold in a dose-dependent manner as compared to untreated controls. The uptake in all other organs, as well as the tumor, was unaffected. A similar reduction in renal retention was seen for all other intracellularly retained isotopes, as well as for F(ab')2 fragments. D- and L-isomers of lysine were equally effective whether given i.p. or p.o. D-glucosamine was effective, but its N-acetyl derivative was not. Basic polypeptides (e.g., poly-L-lysine) were also effective; their potency increased with increasing molecular weight. HPLC of the urine taken from treated animals showed the excretion of intact Fab', in contrast to mostly low-molecular-weight metabolites in the control group. These studies indicate that a variety of basic compounds is capable of inhibiting the tubular reabsorption of peptides and proteins, thus lowering the kidney uptake of antibody fragments significantly. On a molecular basis, the effect seems to essentially rely on the presence of a positively charged amino group. By reducing renal retention of antibody fragments, their role as imaging and therapeutic agents may be expanded.

AB  - Whereas in advanced metastatic medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), a variety of chemotherapeutic regimens have achieved only limited success clinically, more recently, radioimmunotherapy (RIT) with 131I-labeled anti-carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) has shown promising results. The aims of this study were to compare, in an animal model, the therapeutic efficacy of RIT to clinically used "standard" chemotherapeutic regimens and to evaluate whether combination strategies of both modalities may be feasible and may help to improve therapeutic results in this rather radioresistant tumor type. Nude mice, bearing s.c. xenografts of the human MTC cell line, TT, were treated either with the 131I-labeled anti-CEA MAb, F023C5 IgG, or were administered chemotherapeutic regimens that had shown promising results in patients with metastatic MTC (doxorubicin and cisplatinum monotherapy, combinations of both agents, and a 5-fluorouracil/dacarbazine/streptozotocin scheme). Control groups were left untreated or were injected with an irrelevant radiolabeled antibody at equitoxic dose levels. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of each agent was determined. Combinations of chemotherapy and RIT were evaluated as well. Toxicity and tumor growth were monitored at weekly intervals. From the chemotherapeutic agents and schemes tested, doxorubicin monotherapy was the most effective; combination therapies did not result in an increased antitumor efficacy, but they did result in more severe toxicity. At equitoxic doses, no significant difference was found between the therapeutic efficacy of doxorubicin and that of RIT. Myelotoxicity was dose limiting with radiolabeled MAbs (MTD, 600 microCi), as well as with chemotherapeutic regimens containing alkylating agents (cisplatinum, dacarbazine, or streptozotocin). At its MTD (200 microg), doxorubicin caused only mild myelotoxicity, and despite signs of cardiac toxicity, gastrointestinal side effects were dose limiting. Accordingly, bone marrow transplantation (BMT) enabled dose intensification with RIT (MTD with BMT, 1100 microCi), which led to further increased antitumor efficacy, whereas BMT was unable to increase the MTD of doxorubicin. Due to the complementarity of toxic side effects but an anticipated synergism of antitumor efficacy, combinations of RIT with doxorubicin were tested. Administrations of 500 microCi of 131I-labeled anti-CEA and, 48 h later, 200 microg of doxorubicin (i.e., 83 and 100% of the respective single-agent MTDs), were the highest doses that did not result in an increased lethality; with bone marrow support, 1000 microCi of 131I-labeled anti-CEA could be combined with 200 microg of doxorubicin (i.e., 90 and 100% of the individual MTDs). Therapeutic results of this combined radioimmunochemotherapy were superior to equitoxic monotherapy with either agent, and indication for synergistic antitumor effects is given. At its respective MTD, radioimmunochemotherapy led to a 36% cure rate if it was given without bone marrow support and to a 85% permanent cure rate if it was given with bone marrow support. The animal model, as presented in this study, seems to be useful for the preclinical testing of therapeutic agents for the systemic treatment of MTC. At equitoxic doses, RIT with radiolabeled anti-CEA antibodies seems to be equally as effective as chemotherapy with doxorubicin. Combination of RIT and doxorubicin chemotherapy seems to have synergistic therapeutic efficacy, which may be due to a radiosensitizing effect of doxorubicin.

AB  - Background: It has been previously shown that enveloped viruses can be inactivated using aryl azides, such as 1-iodo- 5-azidonaphthalene (INA), plus UVA irradiation with preservation of surface epitopes in the inactivated virus preparations. Prolonged UVA irradiation in the presence of INA results in ROS-species formation, which in turn results in detergent resistant viral protein fractions. Results: Herein, we characterize the applicability of this technique to inactivate influenza. It is shown that influenza virus + INA (100 micromolar) + UVA irradiation for 30 minutes results in a significant (p < 0.05) increase in pelletablehemagglutinin after Triton X-100 treatment followed by ultracentrifugation. Additionally, characterization of the virus suspension by immunogold labeling in cryo-EM, and viral pellet characterization via immunoprecipitation with a neutralizing antibody, shows preservation of neutralization epitopes after this treatment. Conclusion: These orthogonally inactivated viral preparations with detergent resistant fractions are being explored as a novel route for safe, effective inactivated vaccines generated from a variety of enveloped viruses.

AB  - Previously we reported that hydrophobic aryl azides partition into hydrophobic regions of the viral membrane of enveloped viruses and inactivate the virus upon UVA irradiation for 2 min. Prolonged irradiation (15 min) resulted in viral protein aggregation as visualized via Western blot analysis, due to reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, with preservation of the surface antigenic epitopes. Herein, we demonstrate that these aggregates show detergent resistance and that this property may be useful towards the creation of a novel orthogonal virus inactivation strategy for use in preparing experimental vaccines. When ROS-modified HIV virus preparations were treated with 1% Triton X-100, there was an increase in the percent of viral proteins (gp41, p24) in the viral pellet after ultracentrifugation through sucrose. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of these detergent-resistant pellets shows some recognizable virus fragments, and immunoprecipitation studies of the gp41 aggregates suggest the aggregation is covalent in nature, involving short-range interactions.

AB  - Hydrophobic UV-activatable compounds have been shown to partition into the hydrophobic region of biological membranes to selectively label transmembrane proteins, and to inactivate enveloped viruses. Here, we analyze various UV-activatable azido- and iodo-based hydrophobic compounds for their ability to inactivate a model-enveloped virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1 MN). Treatment of HIV-1 with 1,5-diazidonapthalene (DAN), 1-iodo, 5-azidonaphthalene (INA), 1-azidonaphthalene (AzNAP) or 4,4'-diazidobiphenyl (DABIPH) followed by UVA irradiation for 2 min resulted in complete viral inactivation, whereas treatment using analogous non-azido-containing controls had no effect. Incorporation of an azido moiety within these hydrophobic compounds to promote photoinduced covalent reactions with proteins was found to be the primary mechanism of viral inactivation for this class of compounds. Prolonged UVA irradiation of the virus in the presence of these azido compounds resulted in further modifications of viral proteins, due to the generation of reactive oxygen species, leading to aggregation as visualized via Western blot analysis, providing additional viral modifications that may inhibit viral infectivity. Furthermore, inactivation using these compounds resulted in the preservation of surface antigenic structures (recognized by neutralizing antibodies b12, 2g12 and 4e10), which is favorable for the creation of vaccines from these inactivated virus preparations.

AB  - The current opioid crisis and the increase in injection drug use (IDU) have led to outbreaks of HIV in communities across the country. These outbreaks have prompted country and statewide examination into identifying factors to determine areas at risk of a future HIV outbreak. Based on methodology used in a prior nationwide county-level analysis by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), we examined Illinois at the ZIP code level (n = 1,383). Combined acute and chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection among persons <40 years of age was used as an outcome proxy measure for IDU. Local and statewide data sources were used to identify variables that are potentially predictive of high risk for HIV/HCV transmission that fell within three main groups: health outcomes, access/resources, and the social/economic/physical environment. A multivariable negative binomial regression was performed with population as an offset. The vulnerability score for each ZIP code was created using the final regression model that consisted of 11 factors, six risk factors, and five protective factors. ZIP codes identified with the highest vulnerability ranking (top 10%) were distributed across the state yet focused in the rural southern region. The most populous county, Cook County, had only one vulnerable ZIP code. This analysis reveals more areas vulnerable to future outbreaks compared to past national analyses and provides more precise indications of vulnerability at the ZIP code level. The ability to assess the risk at sub-county level allows local jurisdictions to more finely tune surveillance and preventive measures and target activities in these high-risk areas. The final model contained a mix of protective and risk factors revealing a heightened level of complexity underlying the relationship between characteristics that impact HCV risk. Following this analysis, Illinois prioritized recommendations to include increasing access to harm reduction services, specifically sterile syringe services, naloxone access, infectious disease screening and increased linkage to care for HCV and opioid use disorder.

AB  - Structural interventions refer to public health interventions that promote health by altering the structural context within which health is produced and reproduced. They draw on concepts from multiple disciplines, including public health, psychiatry, and psychology, in which attention to interventions is common, and sociology and political economy, where structure is a familiar, if contested, concept. This has meant that even as discussions of structural interventions bring together researchers from various fields, they can get stalled in debates over definitions. In this paper, we seek to move these discussions forward by highlighting a number of critical issues raised by structural interventions, and the subsequent implications of these for research.

AB  - HIV entry involves binding of the trimeric viral envelope glycoprotein (Env) gp120/gp41 to cell surface receptors, which triggers conformational changes in Env that drive the membrane fusion reaction. The conformational landscape that the lipids and Env navigate en route to fusion has been examined by biophysical measurements on the microscale, whereas electron tomography, x-rays, and NMR have provided insights into the process on the nanoscale and atomic scale. However, the coupling between the lipid and protein pathways that give rise to fusion has not been resolved. Here, we discuss the known and unknown about the overall HIV Env-mediated fusion process.

AB  - Fluorescent lipid probes are widely used in the observation of viral membrane fusion, providing a sensitive method to study fusion mechanism(s), Due to the wealth of data concerning liposome fusion, a variety of fusion assays has been designed including fluorescent probe redistribution, fluorescence dequenching, fluorescence resonance energy transfer and photosensitized labeling. These methods can be tailored for different virus fusion assays. For instance, virions can be loaded with membrane dye which dequenches at the moment of membrane merger. This allows for continuous observation of fusion and therefore kinetic information can be acquired, In the case of cells expressing viral envelope proteins, dye redistribution studies of lipidic and water-soluble fluorophores yield information about fusion intermediates. Lipid probes can be metabolically incorporated into cell membranes, allowing observation of membrane fusion in vitro with minimal chance of flip flop, non-specific transfer and formation of microcrystals. Fluorescent lipid probes have been incorporated into liposomes and;;or reconstituted viral envelopes, which provide a well-defined membrane environment for fusion to occur. Interactions of the viral fusion machinery with the membrane can be observed through the photosensitized labeling of the interacting segments of envelope proteins with a hydrophobic probe.

AB  - PURPOSE: In addition to its use as a blood marker for many carcinomas, elevated expression of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA, CD66e, CEACAM5) has been implicated in various biological aspects of neoplasia, especially tumor cell adhesion, metastasis, the blocking of cellular immune mechanisms, and having antiapoptosis functions. However, it is not known if treatment with anti-CEA antibodies can affect tumor metastasis or alter the effects of cytotoxic drugs. METHODS: In vitro, human colon cancer cell lines were treated with anti-CEA MAb IgG1, hMN-14 (labetuzumab), to assess direct effects on proliferation, as well as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). In vivo studies were undertaken in nude mice bearing s.c. (local growth) or i.v. (metastatic model) GW-39 and LS174T human colon cancer grafts, to evaluate the MAb alone and in combination with either CPT-11 or 5-fluorouracil (5FU). RESULTS: In vitro, labetuzumab did not induce apoptosis, nor did it affect tumor cell proliferation directly or by CDC, but it did inhibit tumor cell proliferation by ADCC. In vivo, labetuzumab did not increase median survival in the GW-39 metastatic model unless the mice were pretreated with GM-CSF to increase their peripheral WBC counts; GM-CSF alone was ineffective. Also, if GW-39 tumors were pretreated with IFN-gamma to up-regulate CEA expression threefold prior to i.v. injection, labetuzumab significantly increased median survival of the mice. When nude mice received labetuzumab with CPT-11 or 5FU, median survival increased significantly as compared to the drug or antibody alone. CONCLUSIONS: Labetuzumab, a CEA-specific MAb, induces effector-cell function in vitro against CEA-positive colonic tumor cells, and also inhibits growth of lung metastasis when CEA expression is up-regulated or if peripheral WBCs are increased. The MAb also shows chemosensitizing properties.

AB  - Background. The authors recently reported that a 12-day schedule (beginning 3 days before radioantibody treatment) of twice-daily dosing of rH-IL-1 (1 X 103 U/ dose) and rM-GM-CSF (0.5 mu g/dose) can reduce the magnitude and duration of radioantibody-induced myelosuppression, thereby permitting a 25-30% increase in the dose of radioantibody that can be administered without the dose proving lethal. In an effort to further reduce toxicity and escalate the tolerated dose, the authors altered the method of administration of cytokines from daily bolus dosing to continuous infusion by implantable osmotic pumps. Methods. A control group of mice was compared to five groups of mice that either did or did not receive a 340 mu Ci dose of radioantibody, and received no cytokines, cytokines by bolus dosing, or cytokines by continuous infusion. For 4 weeks, peripheral white blood cell and thrombocyte counts and thymus and spleen weights were taken, marrow cell number was monitored, and marrow colony-forming unit activity was evaluated weekly in the untreated control mice and the treated mice. Results. These studies demonstrated that after a dose of radioantibody, continuous dosing of cytokines resulted in higher white blood cell (WBC) and platelet val-ues than if bolus delivery was used (day 7, WBC: 110% vs. 59%; day 14, WBC: 85% vs. 62%; day 21, WBC: 98% vs. 42%; day 7, platelets: 122% vs. 51%; day 14, platelets: 159% vs. 72%; day 21, platelets: 239% vs. 171%). A comparison of bolus versus continuous dosing in the absence of radioantibody indicated that spleen weight increased by 40-60% after continuous infusion of cytokines and by 20-25% after bolus dosing. The 20-30% decrease in thymus weight was similar with both dosing regimens. Colony-forming units (CFUs) in marrow increased from 30-35 in untreated mice to 50-55 in mice given cytokines by bolus injection, and to 150-180 in mice given continuous infusion of cytokines. Spleen CFUs exhibited an insignificant increase after bolus dosing of cytokines but increased almost fourfold after continuous dosing. Peak stimulation of marrow and spleen CFUs occurred 28 days after initiation of cytokine administration (2 weeks after cytokines administration was stopped). The probability of survival for 6 weeks after further dose escalation to 360 mu Ci I-131-MN-14 immunoglobulin G was 16.4% +/- 8.6% after bolus dosing and 58.1% +/- 11.3% after continuous infusion of cytokines. Conclusions. Although continuous infusion of cytokines proved to be a better method of reducing hematopoietic toxicity, further dose escalation of radioimmunotherapy using the ''pump'' method of cytokine delivery was not possible. Cytokine intervention by either mode of delivery permits a 25% dose intensification without the dose becoming lethal. Further escalation is not feasible, possibly because of other end organ toxicity.

AB  - Myelosuppressive toxicity is dose-limiting for radioimmunotherapy. We have reported on the use of cytokine intervention (rhIL-1 and rmGM-CSF) to stimulate differentiation of progenitor cells and reduce radioantibody-induced leukopenia and thrombocytopenia (J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 84:399, 1992; Cancer 73:1073, 1994). As an alternative to the use of cytokines, we investigated the effect of syngeneic bone marrow transplantation on the ability to dose-escalate radioantibody. Injection of 10(7) bone marrow cells from a donor mouse 6 to 8 days after a 340- to 360-mu Ci dose of radioantibody (LD(100/28))-a 25 to 30% increase above the maximal tolerated dose-resulted in 100% survival. This observation is associated with a recovery in neutrophil and thrombocyte counts within 21 days of therapy (normal recovery after 275 mu Ci takes 42 days). None of the mice survived when BMT was done at either 4 or 11 days after radioantibody. Marrow from normal donor mice was mole effective than that from cytokine-primed mice whose marrow cells were actively cycling after a 5-day course of IL-1/GM-CSF. The combination of the two myeloprotective approaches, BMT plus a 14-day schedule of IL-1 (2x10(3) U/d) and GM-CSF (1 mu g/d) intervention, provided a greater stimulation of peripheral WBC counts than either approach alone; however, further dose escalation under these conditions was not feasible. The 30% intensification in radioantibody dose offers a therapeutic advantage for both bulky disease (GW-39 subcutaneous nude mouse model) and micrometastatic disease (GW-39 intrapulmonary model). In the bulky tumor model, the increase in administered dose resulting from BMT extends the 8-week growth delay observed at 275 mu Ci I-131-MN-14 IgG by an additional 7 weeks. In the metastatic model, dose intensification increased median animal survival from 15 to 23 weeks. Therefore, by optimizing the use of BMT, a greater therapeutic benefit can be derived from radioantibody therapy in a solid tumor model. This study represents a proof of principle, that BMT can be effective for low-dose-rate therapy as it has been for short-duration intense chemotherapy and radiation therapy. It also highlights several important issues to consider when attempting to apply the method in the clinic.

AB  - Therapeutically efficacious doses of 131I-antibody result in a loss in circulating white blood cells; the granulocyte population is suppressed by 80-85% and the agranulocytes by 60-65% following 2 mCi of 131I-antibody in hamsters. The administration of 100,000 units of human recombinant interleukin 1 24 h prior to radioantibody can prevent the loss in WBC from 1 mCi of radioantibody and reduce the loss from 2 mCi of antibody. Recombinant murine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor is also a potent stimulator of myelopoiesis and may also be useful as a method of reducing radioantibody-induced myelosuppression. The tumor uptake of radioantibody in animals treated with recombinant interleukin 1 is reduced by 30% 1 day after injection of radioantibody but returns to levels seen in animals not treated with the cytokine at 96 and 168 h. Therapeutic efficacy is not compromised by doses of interleukin 1 used to prevent myelosuppression. Therefore, the use of cytokines will permit the use of higher doses of radioantibody for greater tumor therapy with less myelotoxicity than in the absence of cytokine treatments.

AB  - The federal ban on funding for syringe exchange programs (SEPs) has greatly hampered attempts to prevent the spread of HIV among injection drug users in the United States. State laws prohibiting the possession and/or distribution of syringes have made SEPs illegal. These factors have lent a unique social movement quality to harm reduction efforts in the United States. Using a social movement perspective, this paper explores dynamics of the implementation and defense of the syringe exchange program in Oakland, California. The advantages and disadvantages of the social movement aspects of harm reduction are discussed.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine if adequate syringe coverage --"one shot for one syringe"--among syringe exchange program (SEP) clients is associated with injection-related HIV risk behaviors and syringe disposal. DESIGN: HIV risk assessments with 1577 injection drug users (IDUs) recruited from 24 SEPs in California between 2001 and 2003. Individual syringe coverage was calculated as a proportion of syringes retained from SEP visits to total number of injections in the last 30 days. RESULTS: Participants were divided into four groups based on syringe coverage: <50%, 50-99%, 100-149%, and 150% or more. In multivariate logistic regression, SEP clients with less than 50% syringe coverage had significantly higher odds of reporting receptive syringe sharing in the last 30 days (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=2.3; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.4, 3.6) and those with 150% or more coverage had lower odds of reporting receptive syringe sharing (AOR=0.5; 95%CI=0.3, 0.8) as compared to SEP clients with adequate syringe coverage of 100-149%. Similar associations were observed for other main outcomes of distributive syringe sharing and syringe re-use. No differences in safe syringe disposal were observed by syringe coverage. CONCLUSIONS: Individual syringe coverage is strongly associated with safer injection behaviors without impacting syringe disposal among SEP clients. Syringe coverage is a useful measure for determining if IDUs are obtaining sufficient syringes to lower HIV risk.

AB  - Community characteristics have been associated with racial and ethnic health disparities for a wide range of ailments and conditions. Previous research has found that rates of AIDS cases among injection drug users (IDUs) vary by community characteristics. However, few studies have examined whether community characteristics are associated with HIV risk behaviors among IDUs. To address this gap in the literature, we examined the associations between census-tract-level community characteristics and injection-related and sex-related HIV risk behaviors among IDUs in the San Francisco Bay Area. Individual HIV risk behaviors were collected from 4,956 IDUs between 1998 and 2002. Using 2000 US census data, we constructed four census-level community measures: percent African American, percent male unemployment, percent of households that receive public assistance, and median household income. All community variables were measured continuously. Multilevel modeling was used to determine if community characteristics were associated with recent (in the last 6 months) receptive and distributive syringe sharing, multiple sex partners, and unprotected sex risk while controlling for potential individual-level confounders. In bivariate analysis, most of the census-tract-level community characteristics were significantly associated with injection-related HIV risk, while no community characteristics were associated with sex-related risk. However, results from multivariate multilevel models indicate that only percent African American in a census tract was associated with receptive [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 0.93; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.89, 0.99] and distributive syringe sharing (AOR = 0.94; 95% CI = 0.92, 0.99), net of individual-level characteristics. Accounting for individual-level factors in the multivariate model in the sex-related risk models revealed a significant inverse relationship between percent African American and propensity to engage in unprotected sex (AOR = 0.95; 95% CI = 0.92, 0.99); community-level characteristics remained unassociated with multiple sex partners. In this exploratory analysis, percent African American in a census tract was inversely associated with injection-related risk. The census-tract-level community characteristics we examined seem to exert little influence on individual risk among long-term chronic IDUs. More research is needed examining the influence of other community characteristics that were unmeasured in this paper but might be related to sex and drug risk among IDUs such as shooting galleries, crack houses, drug markets, and availability of preventive HIV services.

AB  - To determine if frequent needle-exchange program (NEP) use is associated with lower readiness to change drug use, NEP clients in Providence, RI were interviewed regarding their drug use, HIV risk, health, and past use of drug treatment services in 1997-1998. Readiness to change drug use was assessed using a nine-step decision ladder. Based on this assessment, 14.3% of the sample were classified as precontemplators (24/168), 29.2% were in the contemplation stage (49/168), and 56.5% were in the determination or ready to change stage (95/168). We found that mean number of NEP visits was 25.5 among precontemplators, 28.7 among contemplators, and 22.5 among those in the determination stage. In multivariate analysis, an inverse relationship between having ever been in alcohol treatment and higher readiness to change drug use was the only significant association. In this exploratory study, we found that more frequent NEP participation did not impact readiness to change drug use among intravenous drug users. Given the high proportion of NEP clients ready to change drug use, improving linkages between NEPs and substance abuse treatment appears warranted.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We studied the effect of local approval of syringe exchange programs in California (through Assembly AB136) on program availability and performance. METHODS: We determined the number of active syringe exchange programs in California by conducting Internet searches and obtaining information from the state and from local programs. To track changes in program availability and performance between 2000 and 2002, we interviewed 24 program directors annually for 3 years about program characteristics, syringe exchange policies, law enforcement contact, and other issues. We conducted multivariate analyses to determine whether AB136 approval status was associated with changes in performance. RESULTS: Fifteen local governments (13 counties and 2 cities) enacted the new law by 2002, and operating syringe exchange programs increased from 24 to 35. The proportion of these programs that were not locally approved declined from 54% to 40%. No new approved programs were started in high-need counties. Total syringes exchanged increased by more than 1 million per year, average annual budgets increased by more than 50%, and police harassment of the program volunteers, clients, and operators declined. Improvements at approved syringe exchange programs accounted for these changes. CONCLUSIONS: Statewide approval and funding appears necessary to further syringe exchange availability in California.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine factors associated with syringe and injection supply sharing among injection drug users (IDUs) in a community with an illegal underground syringe exchange program (SEP). METHODS: From 1992 to 1995, semiannual cross-sectional samples of IDUs were recruited in Oakland, California. To account for multiple observations from the same individual, we used general estimating equations with logit transformations to determine factors associated with sharing syringes and other injection supplies. RESULTS: 1304 IDUs were interviewed; 684 (53%) returned for more than one interview. 2830 interviews were available for analysis. SEP use increased and syringe and supply sharing declined from 1992 to 1995 among study participants. In multivariate analysis, SEP users were less likely to share syringes than non-SEP users (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.57; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.46-0.72). SEP use was not significantly associated with the sharing of injection supplies (AOR = 0.85; 95% CI = 0.68-1.07). Syringe sharing and injection supply sharing were significantly less likely to occur among African American and HIV-positive IDUs. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that illegal SEPs can be effective HIV prevention programs. Lower rates of syringe-based risk behaviors among African American and HIV-positive IDUs are encouraging.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether syringe exchange program use is associated with cessation of syringe sharing among high-risk injection drug users. DESIGN AND METHODS: Between 1992 and 1996, street-recruited injection drug users were interviewed and received HIV testing and counseling semi-annually, as part of a dynamic cohort study. We examined a cohort of 340 high-risk injection drug users for whom two observations, 6-months apart, were available and who reported syringe sharing at the first interview. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the relationship between syringe exchange program use and cessation of syringe sharing, while controlling for confounding factors. RESULTS: At follow-up interview, 60% (204 of 340) reported quitting syringe sharing. High-risk injection drug users who began using the syringe exchange program were more likely to quit sharing syringes [adjusted odds ratio (AOR), 2.68; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.35-5.33], as were those who continued using the syringe exchange program (AOR,1.98; 95% CI, 1.05-3.75) in comparison with non-syringe exchange program users, while controlling for confounding factors. CONCLUSIONS: The initiation and continuation of syringe exchange program use among high-risk injection drug users is independently associated with cessation of syringe sharing. Syringe exchange program use can be an important component in reducing the spread of blood-borne infectious diseases among high-risk injection drug users.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine trends in HIV infection and risk behaviors among street-recruited self-identified gay and bisexual male injection drug users (IDUs) in San Francisco. METHODS: Trends in HIV infection and risk behaviors were calculated for gay/bisexual ( n = 1594 interviews) IDUs in 26 semiannual cross sections from 1988 to 2000. RESULTS: HIV seroprevalence among gay/bisexual IDUs decreased from the range of 35% to 45% in 1988/1989 to 25% in 1996 and then began to increase, reaching 42% in 2000. In contrast, HIV prevalence among heterosexual male IDUs remained stable during the study period. For gay/bisexual IDUs, injection and sex-related HIV risk behaviors declined modestly throughout the study period. As of the last cross section (July 2000), however, over a third of respondents reported recent syringe sharing or unprotected anal sex. CONCLUSIONS: Gay/bisexual men who inject drugs continue to be at elevated risk for HIV, suggesting that interventions such as amphetamine drug treatment and sexual risk reduction programs targeted at this population are needed.

AB  - AIM: Better sterile syringe access should be associated with a lower likelihood of syringe re-use and receptive syringe sharing, although few empirical studies have examined gradients in syringe access using both individual and ecological data. In this study, we compare syringe re-use and receptive syringe sharing among injection drug users (IDUs) with syringe exchange program (SEP) and legal over-the-counter pharmacy access with limits on syringes that can be purchased, exchanged or possessed to IDUs with no pharmacy sales but unlimited syringe access through SEPs. We address three questions: (1) Does residing in an area with no legal syringe possession increase the likelihood of police contact related to possessing drug paraphernalia? (2) Among direct SEP users, is use of more permissive SEPs associated with less likelihood of syringe re-use and receptive syringe sharing? (3) Among non-SEP users, is residing in an area with pharmacy access associated with lower likelihood of syringe re-use and receptive syringe sharing? DESIGN: Quantitative survey of IDUs recruited from SEPs, subject nomination and outreach methods. Multivariate analyses compared police contact, syringe re-use and receptive syringe sharing among IDUs recruited in three cities. FINDINGS: In multivariate analyses, we found that police contact was associated independently with residing in the area with no legal possession of syringes; among SEP users, those with access to SEPs without limits had lower syringe re-use but not lower syringe sharing; and that among non-SEP users, no significant differences in injection risk were observed among IDUs with and without pharmacy access to syringes. CONCLUSION: We found that greater legal access to syringes, if accompanied by limits on the number of syringes that can be exchanged, purchased and possessed, may not have the intended impacts on injection-related infectious disease risk among IDUs.

AB  - HIV-related stigmas have been seen as a barrier to greater religious congregation involvement in HIV prevention and care in the United States and elsewhere. We explored congregational and community norms and attitudes regarding HIV, sexuality, and drug use through a qualitative case study of 14 diverse religious congregations in Los Angeles County, California between December 2006 and May 2008. Data collected included semi-structured interviews with 57 clergy and lay leaders across the congregations, structured observations of congregational activities, review of archival documents, and a questionnaire on congregational characteristics. Across and within congregations, we found a wide range of views towards HIV, people with HIV, and populations at risk for HIV, from highly judgmental and exclusionary, to "loving the sinner, not the sin," to accepting and affirming. Attitudes and norms about HIV, homosexuality, and substance abuse appeared to be related to the type and intensity of congregational HIV-related activities. However, even among the higher activity congregations, we found a range of perceptions, including ones that were stigmatizing. Results suggest that affirming norms and attitudes are not a prerequisite for a congregation to initiate HIV activities, a finding relevant for HIV service providers and researchers seeking to engage congregations on this issue. HIV stigma reduction is not a prerequisite for congregational HIV involvement: both may occur simultaneously, or one before the other, and they dynamically affect each other. Strategies that are congruent with congregations' current levels of comfort and openness around HIV can themselves facilitate a process of attitudinal and normative change.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Opioid withdrawal symptoms are widely understood to contribute to health risk but have rarely been measured in community samples of opioid using people who inject drugs (PWID). METHODS: Using targeted sampling methods, 814 PWID who reported regular opioid use (at least 12 uses in the last 30 days) were recruited and interviewed about demographics, drug use, health risk, and withdrawal symptoms, frequency, and pain. Multivariable regression models were developed to examine factors associated with any opioid withdrawal, withdrawal frequency, pain severity, and two important health risks (receptive syringe sharing and non-fatal overdose). RESULTS: Opioid withdrawal symptoms were reported by 85 % of participants in the last 6 months, with 29 % reporting at least monthly withdrawal symptoms and 35 % reporting at least weekly withdrawal symptoms. Very or extremely painful symptoms were reported by 57 %. In separate models, we found any opioid withdrawal (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.75, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 1.52, 5.00) and weekly or more opioid withdrawal frequency (AOR = 1.94; 95 % CI = 1.26, 3.00) (as compared to less than monthly) to be independently associated with receptive syringe sharing while controlling for confounders. Any opioid withdrawal (AOR = 1.71; 95 % CI = 1.04, 2.81) was independently associated with nonfatal overdose while controlling for confounders. In a separate model, weekly or more withdrawal frequency (AOR = 1.69; 95 % CI = 1.12, 2.55) and extreme or very painful withdrawal symptoms (AOR = 1.53; 95 % CI = 1.08, 2.16) were associated with nonfatal overdose as well. CONCLUSIONS: Withdrawal symptoms among PWID increase health risk. Treatment of withdrawal symptoms is urgently needed and should include buprenorphine dispensing.

AB  - AIMS: Most people who inject drugs (PWID) were first initiated into injection by a current PWID. Few studies have examined PWID who assist others into drug injection. Our goal is to describe the prevalence of and risk factors for initiating someone into injection in the last 12 months. METHODS: We recruited a cross-sectional sample of PWID (N=605) in California from 2011 to 2013. We examined bivariate and multivariate risk factors for initiating someone into injection with a focus on behaviors that might encourage injection initiation such as injecting in front of non-PWID, describing how to inject to non-PWID, and willingness to initiate someone into drug injection. RESULTS: Having initiated someone into injection was reported by 34% of PWID overall and 7% in the last 12 months. Forty-four PWID had assisted 431 people into injection in the past year. Factors independently associated with initiating someone into injection in the last 12 months were self-reported likelihood of initiating someone in the future (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR]=7.09; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]=3.40, 14.79), having injected another PWID in past month (AOR=4.05; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.94, 8.47), having described how to inject to non-injectors (2.61; 95% CI=1.19, 5.71), and non-injection powder cocaine use in past month (AOR=4.97; 95% CI=2.08, 11.84) while controlling for study site. CONCLUSION: Active PWID are important in facilitating the process of drug injection uptake. Interventions to reduce initiation should include efforts to change behaviors and intentions among PWID that are associated with injection uptake among others.

AB  - This study examined condom attitudes, preferences, barriers, and use among a sample of 550 injection drug using clients of syringe exchange programs in California. In multivariate analyses, positive attitudes toward condoms were significantly associated with consistent condom use for vaginal, anal, and oral sex in the past six months, beyond the effects of confounding socio-demographic and HIV risk variables. Participants commonly cited partner-related barriers to condom use, such as reluctance to use condoms with steady partners (34%). Almost a quarter of the sample cited dislike of condoms (e.g., because of pleasure reduction). In addition, a third of respondents stated specific preferences regarding condom brands, sensitivity, sizes, and textures. Interventions that increase awareness about positive aspects of condom use and sexual risk from steady partners may be successful in increasing condom use among injection drug users.

AB  - Prescription and illicit opioids were involved in over 42,000 deaths in the USA in 2016. Rural counties experience higher rates of opioid prescribing and, although opioid prescribing rates have fallen in recent years, the rate of decline is less in rural areas. The sociocultural context of rural life may impact opioid misuse in important ways; however, little research directly explores this possibility. We performed a systematic review of English-language manuscripts in U.S. context to determine what is known about social networks, norms, and stigma in relation to rural opioid misuse. Of nine articles identified and reviewed, two had only primary findings associated with social networks, norms, or stigma, five had only secondary findings, and two had both primary and secondary findings. The normalization of prescription opioid use along with environmental factors likely impacts the prevalence of opioid misuse in rural communities. Discordant findings exist regarding the extent to which social networks facilitate or protect against nonmedical opioid use. Lastly, isolation, lack of treatment options, social norms, and stigma create barriers to substance use treatment for rural residents. Although we were able to identify important themes across multiple studies, discordant findings exist and, in some cases, findings rely on single studies. The paucity of research examining the role of social networks, norms, and stigma in relation to nonmedical opioid use in rural communities is evident in this review. Scholarship aimed at exploring the relationship and impact of rurality on nonmedical opioid use is warranted.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has worsened the opioid overdose crisis in the US. Rural communities have been disproportionately affected by opioid use and people who use drugs in these settings may be acutely vulnerable to pandemic-related disruptions due to high rates of poverty, social isolation, and pervasive resource limitations. METHODS: We performed a mixed-methods study to assess the impact of the pandemic in a convenience sample of people who use drugs in rural Illinois. We conducted 50 surveys capturing demographics, drug availability, drug use, sharing practices, and mental health symptoms. In total, 19 qualitative interviews were performed to further explore COVID-19 knowledge, impact on personal and community life, drug acquisition and use, overdose, and protective substance use adaptations. RESULTS: Drug use increased during the pandemic, including the use of fentanyl products such as gel encapsulated "beans" and "buttons". Disruptions in supply, including the decreased availability of heroin, increased methamphetamine costs and a concomitant rise in local methamphetamine production, and possible fentanyl contamination of methamphetamine was reported. Participants reported increased drug use alone, experience and/or witness of overdose, depression, anxiety, and loneliness. Consistent access to harm reduction services, including naloxone and fentanyl test strips, was highlighted as a source of hope and community resiliency. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic period was characterized by changing drug availability, increased overdose risk, and other drug-related harms faced by people who use drugs in rural areas. Our findings emphasize the importance of ensuring access to harm reduction services, including overdose prevention and drug checking for this vulnerable population.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: While inadequate nutrition can weaken the immune system and lead to negative health sequelae for vulnerable populations, little is known about nutritional intake among people who inject drugs (PWID). We aimed to quantify nutritional intake among PWID and to explore associations between protein intake and drug use. METHODS: A cross-sectional design was used to analyze self-reported participant data. PWID were recruited from community settings in California in 2016/2017. Participants reported on food consumption per day for a 30-day period, from which a continuous protein intake variable was created. RESULTS: Modal characteristics of participants (N = 937) were: white (42.5%), male (75.3%), healthy body mass index (BMI) (56.6%), and unhoused (82.9%). Less than 1% of participants met or exceeded recommended guidelines for protein intake (0.80 g/day/1 kg body weight). The final multiple regression model found protein intake to be significantly positively associated with older age, high school or greater education, frequency of opiate and marijuana use, while Latinx ethnicity was inversely associated with protein intake, adjusting for gender. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows PWID are generally not underweight, yet they are grossly protein deficient, which can be harder to recognize. Poverty, homelessness, and other structural barriers likely contribute to this issue, which demonstrates the need for communities to provide more access to nutrient-rich food to PWID. SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE: Our study demonstrates the novel findings that opiate and marijuana use frequency, but not stimulants (methamphetamine and cocaine) may increase preference for protein-rich foods among PWID.

AB  - Booth: Since early in the HIV epidemic, street outreach workers, often indigenous to the tar-get population, have served both to recruit drug injectors for interventions and to conduct interventions. The typically unstructured nature of outreach interventions present challenges in determining the nature of services actually delivered. It is recommended that both qualitative and quantitative methods be utilized to monitor intervention service delivery. Des Jarlais: The threat of AIDS has led to profound behavioral changes among drug users. These changes need to be seen primarily not as responses to public health interventions, but in terms of the competencies of drug users themselves. A Drug User Competency Model of HIV Prevention would include: 1. Competency in understanding HIV transmission, 2. Competency in reducing HIV risk behavior, and 3. The competency of altruism. Friedman: Twenty years of work on HIV among drug users' highlight that we need to incorporate large-scale social dynamics in research and interventions, understand drug users sexual behavior and networks, and view drug users as multifaceted human beings, not just 'walking addictions.' Crucially, drug users can be highly competent at many things, so non-users can learn from their ideas and their practices. Drug users can be partners and sometimes leaders, not just 'disabled addicts.'

AB  - There is a persistent bias toward higher prevalence and increased severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in males. Underlying mechanisms accounting for this sex difference remain incompletely understood. Interferon responses have been implicated as a modulator of COVID-19 disease in adults and play a key role in the placental antiviral response. Moreover, the interferon response has been shown to alter Fc receptor expression and therefore may affect placental antibody transfer. Here, we examined the intersection of maternal-fetal antibody transfer, viral-induced placental interferon responses, and fetal sex in pregnant women infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Placental Fc receptor abundance, interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression, and SARS-CoV-2 antibody transfer were interrogated in 68 human pregnancies. Sexually dimorphic expression of placental Fc receptors, ISGs and proteins, and interleukin-10 was observed after maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection, with up-regulation of these features in placental tissue of pregnant individuals with male fetuses. Reduced maternal SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody titers and impaired placental antibody transfer were also observed in pregnancies with a male fetus. These results demonstrate fetal sex-specific maternal and placental adaptive and innate immune responses to SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - Latino youth are at high risk for acquiring HIV during adolescence. The present study documented the nature of adolescent romantic relationships among 702 Latino eighth grade students and their mothers in the Bronx, NY. The study examined adolescent romantic relationships, the association between participation in such relationships and intentions to engage in sexual risk behavior, and maternal influences on adolescent's involvement in intimate behaviors in romantic relationships. Almost 50% of youth had been in a romantic relationship, which typically lasted 3-3.5 months. Mothers tended to approve of intimate behaviors and sexual activity in romantic relationships more so for males than females. Latino youth tended to underestimate maternal disapproval of a range of intimate behaviors, and the correlations between perceived and actual maternal approval were generally low in magnitude. Finally, maternal orientations towards their adolescent engaging in romantic relationships were associated with their child's intentions to have sexual intercourse in the future.

AB  - The purpose of the present study was to examine the feasibility of conducting a parent-based intervention in a pediatric health clinic to prevent HIV, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and unintended pregnancies among urban African American and Latino youth. Eight focus groups were conducted with health care providers, adolescent patients and the mothers of adolescent patients (n = 41) from December 2007 to February 2008. All participants were recruited from a community-based pediatric health clinic in the Bronx, New York. Content analysis of focus group transcripts identified results in three primary areas: (1) the role of parents and providers in preventing HIV, STDs and unintended pregnancies among adolescents, (2) feasibility of the intervention in the clinic setting; and (3) optimal recruitment, retention and intervention delivery strategies. Study results suggest that a parent-based intervention delivered in a community-based pediatric health clinic setting is feasible. Focused recommendations for intervention recruitment, delivery, and retention are provided.

AB  - Relatively little is known about how parents influence the health and well-being of lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) adolescents and young adults. This gap has led to a paucity of parent-based interventions for LGB young people. A systematic literature review on parental influences on the health of LGB youth was conducted to better understand how to develop a focused program of applied public health research. Five specific areas of health among LGB young people aged 10-24 years old were examined: (a) sexual behavior; (b) substance use; (c) violence and victimization; (d) mental health; and (e) suicide. A total of 31 quantitative articles were reviewed, the majority of which were cross-sectional and relied on convenience samples. Results indicated a trend to focus on negative, and not positive, parental influences. Other gaps included a dearth of research on sexual behavior, substance use, and violence/victimization; limited research on ethnic minority youth and on parental influences identified as important in the broader prevention science literature; and no studies reporting parent perspectives. The review highlights the need for future research on how parents can be supported to promote the health of LGB youth. Recommendations for strengthening the research base are provided.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purposes of this study were to document the HIV testing behaviors and serostatus of younger men of color who have sex with men (YMSM) and to explore sociodemographic, behavioral, and maternal correlates of HIV testing in the past 6 months. METHODS: A total of 135 YMSM aged 16-19 years completed a close-ended survey on HIV testing and risk behaviors, mother-son communication, and sociodemographic characteristics. Youth were offered point-of-care HIV testing, with results provided at survey end. Multivariate logistic regression analyzed the sociodemographic, behavioral, and maternal factors associated with routine HIV testing. RESULTS: A total of 90.3% of YMSM had previously tested for HIV, and 70.9% had tested in the past 6 months. In total, 11.7% of youth reported being HIV positive, and 3.3% reported unknown serostatus. When offered an HIV test, 97.8% accepted. Of these, 14.7% had a positive oral test result, and 31.58% of HIV-positive YMSM (n = 6) were seropositive unaware. Logistic regression results indicated that maternal communication about sex with males was positively associated with routine testing (odds ratio = 2.36; 95% confidence interval = 1.13-4.94). Conversely, communication about puberty and general human sexuality was negatively associated (odds ratio = .45; 95% confidence interval = .24-.86). Condomless anal intercourse and positive sexually transmitted infection history were negatively associated with routine testing; however, frequency of alcohol use was positively associated. CONCLUSIONS: Despite high rates of testing, we found high rates of HIV infection, with 31.58% of HIV-positive YMSM being seropositive unaware. Mother-son communication about sex needs to address same-sex behavior as this appears to be more important than other topics. YMSM with known risk factors for HIV are not testing at the recommended time intervals.

AB  - HIV-positive young black MSM (YBMSM) experience poor outcomes along the HIV care continuum, yet few interventions have been developed expressly for YBMSM retention in care. Project nGage was a randomized controlled trial conducted across five Chicago clinics with 98 HIV-positive YBMSM aged 16-29 between 2012 and 2015. The intervention used a social network elicitation approach with index YBMSM (n = 45) to identify and recruit a support confidant (SC) to the study. Each index-SC dyad met with a social worker to improve HIV-care knowledge, activate dyadic social support, and develop a retention in care plan. Each index and SC also received four mini-booster sessions. Control participants (n = 53) received treatment as usual. Surveys and medical records at baseline, 3-, and 12-months post-intervention assessed visit history (3 or more visits over 12 months; primary outcome), and sociodemographic, network, social-psychological, and behavioral factors. At baseline, there were no differences in age (M = 23.8 years), time since diagnosis (M ≤ 2 years), clinic visits in the previous 12 months (M = 4.1), and medication adherence (68.6 ≥ 90% adherence). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, intervention participants were 3.01 times more likely to have had at least 3 provider visits (95% CI 1.0-7.3) than were control participants over 12 months. Project nGage demonstrates preliminary efficacy in improving retention in care among YBMSM. Results suggest that engaging supportive network members may improve key HIV care continuum outcomes.

AB  - This paper presents findings from a focus group study conducted to evaluate The Source, an alternate reality game (ARG). ARGs are a relatively new genre of interactive digital games that use a variety of media to engage game players. We developed modules on sexual health, sexual orientation, and homophobia in a game that was delivered to 133 predominantly African-American and Latino US youth. Ten focus groups were conducted with 43 young people aged 13-18who played The Source to understand feasibility and acceptability issues and the impact of the game on young people's attitudes, knowledge, and behaviours. Data were transcribed and analysed for common themes by two independent coders. Four primary themes were identified: (1) the feasibility and acceptability of using an ARG for sexual education; (2) the acceptability of The Source's specific sexual health content; (3) the game's influence on sexual health-related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours; and (4) the impact of the game on young people's thoughts and responses to sexual orientation and homophobia. Study findings indicate that an ARG is an exciting and interactive way to educate young people on sensitive topics in sexuality education, but that attention to narrative authenticity and effective messaging are important issues to address.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Young Black men who have sex with men and transgender persons (YBMSMT) aged 13-29 carry the nation's highest burden of new HIV infections. Studies indicate that YBMSMT have poor retention in care, which is associated with reduced medication adherence and increased virologic failure. OBJECTIVE: Project nGage is a randomized controlled (RCT) trial evaluating the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a brief, dyadic intervention designed to promote adherence to HIV primary care in safety-net clinics. Network visualization is used to identify and engage a support confidant (SC) from participants' social networks. A social work interventionist then meets with the SC and SC-participant dyad to activate and maintain HIV-specific social support. METHODS: Project nGage is operating in two phases. In Phase I, the Team refined study protocols based on pilot testing. In Phase II, 94 HIV infected YBMSMT ages 16-29 will be recruited, enrolled and randomly assigned to receive Project nGage or treatment as usual (TAU). The primary outcome is appointment attendance; the secondary outcomes are medication adherence and viral load. RESULTS: Implementation challenges include coordinating sites, managing dyadic intervention logistics, and recruiting non-adherent patients or those who have fallen out of care. The team continues to address implementation issues as the study progresses. CONCLUSIONS: Project nGage is addressing a gap in HIV care-related research by focusing on supportive relationships as a mechanism through which to promote retention in care. Pending study results, a larger RCT would compare the relative effectiveness of the Project nGage intervention versus TAU over 18 to 24 months.

AB  - HIV incidence among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Greece remains unchanged despite effective response to a recent outbreak among people who inject drugs (PWID). Network factors are increasingly understood to drive transmission in epidemics. The primary objective of the study was to characterize MSM in Greece, their sexual behaviors, and sexual network mixing patterns. We investigated the relationship between serostatus, sexual behaviors, and self-reported sex networks in a sample of MSM in Athens, Greece, generated using respondent driven sampling. We estimated mixing coefficients (r) based on survey-generated egonets. Additionally, multiple logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (AOR) and to assess relationships between serostatus, sexual behaviors, and sociodemographic indicators. A sample of 1,520 MSM participants included study respondents (n = 308) and their network members (n = 1,212). Mixing based on serostatus (r = 0.12, σ(r) = 0.09-0.15) and condomless sex (r = 0.11, σ(r) = 0.07-0.14) was random. However, mixing based on sex-drug use was highly assortative (r = 0.37, σ(r) = 0.32-0.42). This study represents the first analysis of Greek MSM sexual networks. Our findings highlight protective behavior in two distinct network typologies. The first typology mixed assortatively based on serostatus and sex-drug use and was less likely to engage in condomless sex. The second typology mixed randomly based on condomless sex but was less likely to engage in sex-drug use. These findings support the potential benefit of HIV prevention program scale-up for this population including but not limited to PrEP.

AB  - This paper estimates the prevalence of current injection drug users (IDUs) in 96 large U.S. metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) annually from 1992 to 2002. Multiplier/allocation methods were used to estimate the prevalence of injectors because confidentiality restrictions precluded the use of other commonly used estimation methods, such as capture-recapture. We first estimated the number of IDUs in the U.S. each year from 1992 to 2002 and then apportioned these estimates to MSAs using multiplier methods. Four different types of data indicating drug injection were used to allocate national annual totals to MSAs, creating four distinct series of estimates of the number of injectors in each MSA. Each series was smoothed over time; and the mean value of the four component estimates was taken as the best estimate of IDUs for that MSA and year (with the range of component estimates indicating the degree of uncertainty in the estimates). Annual cross-sectional correlations of the MSA-level IDU estimates with measures of unemployment, hepatitis C mortality prevalence, and poisoning mortality prevalence were used to validate our estimates. MSA-level IDU estimates correlated moderately well with validators, demonstrating adequate convergence validity. Overall, the number of IDUs per 10,000 persons aged 15-64 years varied from 30 to 348 across MSAs (mean 126.9, standard deviation 65.3, median 106.6, interquartile range 78-162) in 1992 and from 37 to 336 across MSAs (mean 110.6, standard deviation 57.7, median 96.1, interquartile range 67-134) in 2002. A multilevel model showed that overall, across the 96 MSAs, the number of injectors declined each year until 2000, after which the IDU prevalence began to increase. Despite the variation in component estimates and methodological and component data set limitations, these local IDU prevalence estimates may be used to assess: (1) predictors of change in IDU prevalence; (2) differing IDU trends between localities; (3) the adequacy of service delivery to IDUs; and (4) infectious disease dynamics among IDUs across time.

Despite the variation in component estimates and methodological and component data set limitations, these local IDU prevalence estimates may be used to assess: (1) predictors of change in IDU prevalence; (2) differing IDU trends between localities; (3) the adequacy of service delivery to ID Us; and (4) infectious disease dynamics among ID Us across time.

AB  - Throughout the US, high-visibility drug markets are concentrated in neighborhoods with few economic opportunities, while drug buyers/users are widely dispersed. A study of Pittsburgh Syringe Exchange participants provides data on travel between and network linkages across neighborhoods with different levels of drug activity. There are distinct racial patterns to syringe distribution activity within networks and across neighborhoods. Pittsburgh's history suggests these patterns emerge from historical patterns of social and economic development. Study data demonstrate the ability of IDUs to form long term social ties across racial and geographic boundaries and use them to reduce the risk of HIV transmission.

AB  - In 2004, GLBT and HIV/AIDS service providers in NYC mobilized against use of crystal methamphetamine among gay men. Both drug use and mobilization were shaped by the history of HIV, particularly the institutions, action repertoires, and social networks forged in earlier AIDS work. This paper is based on qualitative research conducted from 2007 to 2009 with advocates, service providers, and men who have sex with men recruited from diverse venues in NYC gay communities. The crystal use epidemic among gay men in NYC indicates the importance of social and historical context in shaping drug use and antidrug mobilization, including the potential for public health responses to drug use.

AB  - Understanding the dynamics of sexual risks for HIV among men who have sex with men has been one of the ongoing challenges of HIV prevention. While the majority of HIV-prevention interventions target individual behaviour and decision making, multiple studies point to the importance of social context in shaping risk behaviour. Analysis of qualitative data from a study of men who have sex with men, drug use and sex found that sexual encounters were made up multiple contextual and interpersonal elements, which interacted to shape sexual practices and risk reduction strategies. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 60 racially diverse men who have sex with men in NYC, recruited from multiple venues. The majority of respondents were gay-identified and half were 40 or older. Respondents described risk assessment and risk-reduction processes that develop throughout a sexual encounter, embedded in ongoing negotiations of sexual practices. Strategies of risk assessment and reduction draw on probability-based approaches to HIV prevention, presenting a challenge to health education.

AB  - Research on men who sell sex has primarily focused on psychological profiles and HIV risk factors. Substantially less literature examines the consumers in the male-to-male exchange sex dyad. This article examines the perspectives of venders and consumers. Data come from a qualitative study of a group of 26 men who recently exchanged sex for money or drugs in New York City. Findings indicate that a complex set of interactions between motivation, communication, medium of exchange, and access to capital-financial, drug, or sexual-shapes risks. This article includes discussion of the potential implications of these findings for practitioners, and future research.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: The prevalence of persistent diabetic macular edema (DME) after months of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy and its effect on visual acuity are unknown. OBJECTIVE: To assess subsequent outcomes of eyes with DME persisting for 24 weeks after initiating treatment with 0.5 mg of ranibizumab. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We performed post hoc, exploratory analyses of a randomized clinical trial from March 20, 2007, through January 29, 2014, from 117 of 296 eyes (39.5%) randomly assigned to receive ranibizumab with persistent DME (central subfield thickness ≥250 μm on time domain optical coherence tomography) through the 24-week visit. INTERVENTIONS: Four monthly intravitreous injections of ranibizumab and then as needed per protocol. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cumulative 3-year probabilities of chronic persistent DME (failure to achieve a central subfield thickness <250 μm and at least a 10% reduction from the 24-week visit on at least 2 consecutive study visits) determined by life-table analyses, and at least 10 letter (≥2 line) gain or loss of visual acuity among those eyes. RESULTS: The probability of chronic persistent DME among eyes with persistent DME at the 24-week visit decreased from 100% at the 32-week visit to 81.1% (99% CI, 69.6%-88.6%), 55.8% (99% CI, 42.9%-66.9%), and 40.1% (99% CI, 27.4%-52.4%) at the 1-, 2-, and 3-year visits, respectively. At 3 years, visual acuity improved in eyes with and without chronic persistent DME through the follow-up period, respectively, by a mean of 7 letters and 13 letters from baseline. Among 40 eyes with chronic persistent edema through 3 years, 17 (42.5%) (99% CI, 23.1%-63.7%) gained 10 letters or more from baseline, whereas 5 (12.5%) (99% CI, 2.8%-31.5%) lost 10 letters or more from baseline. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These data suggest less than half of eyes treated for DME with intravitreous ranibizumab have persistent central-involved DME through 24 weeks after initiating treatment. Among the 40% that then have chronic persistent central-involved DME through 3 years, longer-term visual acuity outcomes appear to be slightly worse than in the 60% in which DME does not persist. Nevertheless, when following the treatment protocol used in this trial among eyes with vision impairment from DME, long-term improvement in visual acuity from baseline is typical and substantial (≥2-line) loss of visual acuity is likely uncommon through 3 years, even when central-involved DME chronically persists.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We describe the background, rationale, intervention components, and formative results of a demonstration project aimed to ameliorate five socio-structural barriers to HIV services for young Black men aged 18-29 living with and at risk for HIV in Louisiana. METHODS: The interventions and activities consisted of (1) five person-centered approaches to enhance linkage to HIV services and improve socio-economic outcomes; (2) the implementation of systematic mystery shopping tests to document instances of housing discrimination; (3) the development and implementation of a multi-prong communications campaign to increase knowledge about the signs of housing discrimination and community resources among young Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM); (4) the integration of HIV/STI services and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and trans (LGBT)-inclusive events on Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs); and (5) the development of a safe space for YBMSM. A multi-method approach was used to evaluate the outcomes of the different interventions. RESULTS: The majority (62%) of participants living with HIV were linked to HIV care and 49% had achieved viral suppression. More than 40% of participants were employed during the project. Thirty-seven percent (37%) of the mystery shopping tests showed definite or possible signs of housing discrimination. The housing campaign's duration was limited with unknown long-term impact among YBMSM. Fifteen cases of syphilis were identified during two HBCU events. A safe space was specifically created for YBMSM at a community-based organization. CONCLUSION: Multi-component holistic health interventions are needed to improve HIV outcomes and curb the high HIV rates among young Black men, particularly YBMSM in the United States and the Deep South.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: HIV-related stigma continues to serve as a major barrier to HIV care. HIV stigma reduction interventions are urgently needed to promote and protect the health of persons living with HIV (PLWH). Resilience has been identified as a potential leverage to mitigate the impact of HIV-related stigma among PLWH. METHODS: We examined whether two resilience measures (i.e., social support and resilience assets and resources [RAR]) moderated the relationship between experienced HIV stigma and the HIV care continuum as well as how they moderated the relationship between the consequences of experienced HIV stigma (CES) and the HIV care continuum among 300 PLWH in Louisiana. Separate bootstrapping analyses were conducted to test for evidence of moderated moderation. RESULTS: Most participants were Black (79%) and had been living with HIV for 10 years or more. A relatively high sample of men who have sex with men (MSM) were enrolled (37%). The most common CES were depression (67%). The most common manifestation of experienced HIV stigma was being gossiped about (53%). Participants reported moderate levels of social support. In terms of RAR, most participants (71%) reported that they knew of groups that could support them in responding to experienced HIV stigma. After adjusting for potential covariates, social support and RAR both significantly moderated the relationship between experienced HIV stigma and length of time since their last HIV care visit, B(SE) = .003(.001), p = .03. At high levels of RAR and high levels of social support, those with higher levels of experienced HIV stigma reported a longer length of time since their last HIV care visit than those who reported lower levels of experienced HIV stigma (B(SE) = .17(.04), p < .001). RAR moderated the relationship between social support and HIV care, B(SE) = .01(.004), p < .001. Those who experienced greater CES reported a longer length of time since their last doctor's visit B(SE) = .04(.02), p < .05. Experienced HIV stigma was not significantly associated with viral load results. However, social support significantly moderated the relationship between experienced stigma and viral load results. At higher levels of social support, those who experienced lower levels of stigma were more likely to report an undetectable viral load than those who had higher levels of stigma, B(SE) = - .13(.03), p < .001. Finally, both RAR and social support moderated the relationship between CES and viral load results. Those who reported higher levels of RAR B(SE) = - .07(.02), p < .001, and social support, B(SE) = - .02(.01), p < .05, also reported having an undetectable viral load at most recent HIV care visit. CES was not significantly related to reporting an undetectable viral load (p = .61). CONCLUSIONS: Enrolled PLWH already have some level of resilience which plays an important protective role within the context of the HIV care continuum up to a certain extent. Interventions to enhance the RAR and social support components may be useful especially among MSM and persons who have been living with HIV for a shorter period of time.

AB  - The various forms of HIV-related stigma continue to serve as major barriers to HIV care and treatment among men who have sex with men (MSM). The study of resilience within the context of HIV-related stigma among MSM living with HIV represents a promising area of research to inform the development of future HIV interventions for this population. We examined resilience within the context of HIV related stigma among MSM living with HIV in Louisiana with a particular interest in how resilience may be more relevant for Black MSM. We utilized Pearson's correlations and layered chi-square non-parametric tests to examine associations and racial differences in resilience, four HIV-related stigma measures/consequences (i.e., anticipated, internalized, enacted, and consequences of enacted HIV stigma), and HIV care outcomes (i.e., length of time since last HIV care visit, time since last HIV lab result, most recent HIV viral load result) among 110 MSM living with HIV in Louisiana who participated in the Louisiana HIV Stigma Index Project. The majority of MSM participants were Black (75%), lived in New Orleans (52%), and reported limited education (52%) and income (76%). MSM who reported higher levels of enacted HIV stigma, consequences of enacted HIV stigma, and internalized HIV stigma reported poorer HIV care outcomes. Both internalized and anticipated HIV stigma significantly negatively impacted Black MSM perceptions of their overall health compared with White MSM. Compared with White MSM, Black MSM who reported greater consequences of enacted HIV stigma had poorer HIV care outcomes. Resilience was associated with positive HIV care outcomes for both Black and White MSM. However, having higher levels of resilience may have been more protective for Black MSM such that higher levels of resilience were associated with less time since last HIV care visit for Black MSM than for White MSM. The current study provides preliminary information on the potential positive relationship between resilience and HIV care outcomes among MSM, particularly Black MSM. However, these findings need to be confirmed among a more representative sample of Black and White MSM in Louisiana.

AB  - Durable viral suppression (DVS) is needed to reduce HIV transmission risk and prevent new HIV infections. We examined changes in viral suppression and correlates of DVS among 97 criminal justice-involved (CJI) Black men living with HIV in Louisiana enrolled in a linkage, re-engagement, and retention in care intervention. Most participants (75%) were Black men who have sex with men. Forty-four percent (44%) were virally suppressed at baseline and only 20% had achieved DVS over a 12-month period. Multinomial logistic regression analyses showed that compared with DVS participants, those with no viral suppression (NVS) and some viral suppression (SVS) were more likely to have lived with HIV for a longer period of time and were less likely to be adherent at baseline. Medication adherence was critical for DVS among this sample of CJI Black men living with HIV who represent a high priority population for HIV care and treatment interventions.

AB  - Black men who have sex with men (BMSM) and Black transgender women (BTW) are impacted by dual epidemics of HIV and incarceration. We advanced understanding of the relationship between criminal justice involvement, HIV, and other key HIV-related characteristics among these key populations in the US. We conducted a systematic review up to 2018 and 47 articles met the inclusion criteria of scientific publications involving quantitative findings of US-based HIV-related studies focused on criminal justice-involved (CJI) BMSM and BTW. Overall, there was a dearth of studies focused specifically on BTW. Criminal justice involvement was relatively high among BMSM and BTW and more pronounced among BTW. The current evidence favors no association between incarceration and HIV acquisition among BMSM with limited information about BTW. Criminal justice involvement was associated with a greater likelihood of STIs among BMSM with mixed results for sexual risk behaviors. Criminal justice settings served as an important venue for HIV testing/diagnosis for both BMSM and BTW. However, these settings were not conducive for subsequent stages of the HIV care continuum. Studies pointed to an independent association between criminal justice involvement, substance use, housing instability, and greater odds of incarceration among BMSM who were unemployed and had limited education. Future incarceration was associated with high levels of perceived racism among BMSM. Among young BMSM, high network criminal justice prevalence was also associated with sexual risk behaviors, poorer mental health outcomes, drug use, and housing instability. CJI BMSM and BTW represent a critical subpopulation to end the HIV epidemic in the US.

AB  - Membrane fusion mediated by interaction of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope glycoprotein with the human CD4 molecule generally requires that the CD4 be expressed on a human cell. The failure of murine or simian cells expressing human CD4 to form syncytia upon mixing with cells expressing envelope glycoprotein could not be corrected by expression of both molecules at extremely high surface levels using vaccinia virus expression vectors. Video fluorescence microscopic analysis of fluorescent dye transfer between fusing cells indicated that the block occurred at the level of membrane fusion between individual pairs of cells. To gain insight into the basis for this fusion block, we tested the ability of fluorescent probe cells expressing envelope glycoprotein to fuse with transient animal x human hybrid giant cells expressing human CD4. The hybrid giant cells were generated either by low-pH-induced fusion of vaccinia-infected cells or by CD4/HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein-mediated cell fusion. We observed that envelope glycoprotein-expressing probe cells efficiently fused with CD4-expressing animal x human hybrid giant cells, independent of whether the CD4 was originally expressed on the animal or on the human cell. Fusion did not occur with CD4-expressing giant cells derived from animal cells alone. These results indicate that the fusion block is not due to dominant inhibitory components in the animal cell. Rather, they suggest that human cells contain an additional component(s) which, when transferred to the CD4-bearing animal cell, confers the ability to undergo membrane fusion mediated by the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein.

AB  - Cannabis plays a role in symptoms management in HIV, especially the alleviation of pain and nausea and stimulation of appetite, and prevalence of cannabis use in HIV-positive populations exceeds that of the general U.S. population. Previous research has described an "overlap" between medical and recreational cannabis use among persons living with HIV. To understand better the motives associated cannabis use among young men who have sex with men living with HIV (HIV+ YMSM), we conducted semi-structured interviews with 30 HIV+YMSM in Denver and Chicago. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and coded by a diverse team of analysts. In addition to findings that mapped onto previously identified medical motives and recreational motives, we identified several themes that straddled medical and recreational use in a domain we describe as therapeutic. Themes identified in this therapeutic domain of cannabis use include (a) enhanced introspection among individuals that promotes psychological adjustment to an HIV diagnosis, improved medical management, and future orientation; (b) reflection processes that mitigate interpersonal conflict and improve interpersonal communication; and (c) a social-therapeutic phenomena of cannabis use among young persons with living HIV that is characterized by both enhanced introspection and improved interpersonal communication. Our findings suggest a spectrum of cannabis use among HIV+ YMSM that may be characterized not only by an overlap between medical and recreational use, but also by a distinct therapeutic domain that incorporates stress alleviation and cognitive expansion processes to improve focus on HIV management and self-care.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate perfluorotri-n-propylamine, a perfluorocarbon oil, as a temporary vitreous replacement in rabbits. METHODS: After undergoing gas compression vitrectomy, rabbits were injected with perfluorotri-n-propylamine for 24 hours or 2 weeks. The rabbits were evaluated clinically and with electroretinography. The globes were then enucleated and processed for histological evaluation. RESULTS: Clinical results showed droplet dispersion in the 2-week but not in the 24-hour group. Histological evaluation showed no changes in the retinal pigment epithelium or photoreceptor outer segments. Foam cells were seen in the 2-week but not in the 24-hour group. There was a marked dampening of the electroretinographic response that normalized after the removal of the oil. CONCLUSIONS: Perfluorotri-n-propylamine demonstrated no retinal toxic side effects in rabbits and is a promising liquid perfluorocarbon oil.

AB  - Preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for prevention of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection may benefit not only the person who uses it but also their uninfected sexual risk contacts. We developed an agent-based model using a novel trial emulation approach to quantify disseminated effects of PrEP use among men who have sex with men in Atlanta, Georgia, from 2015 to 2017. Model components (subsets of agents connected through partnerships in a sexual network but not sharing partnerships with any other agents) were first randomized to an intervention coverage level or the control group; then, within intervention components, eligible agents were randomized to receive or not receive PrEP. We calculated direct and disseminated (indirect) effects using randomization-based estimators and report corresponding 95% simulation intervals across scenarios ranging from 10% coverage in the intervention components to 90% coverage. A population of 11,245 agents was simulated, with an average of 1,551 components identified. When comparing agents randomized to no PrEP in 70% coverage components with control agents, there was a 15% disseminated risk reduction in HIV incidence (risk ratio = 0.85, 95% simulation interval: 0.65, 1.05). Persons not on PrEP may receive a protective benefit by being in a sexual network with higher PrEP coverage. Agent-based models are useful for evaluating possible direct and disseminated effects of HIV prevention modalities in sexual networks.

AB  - Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) interventions among people who use drugs (PWUD) often have spillover, also known as interference or dissemination, which occurs when one participant's exposure affects another participant's outcome. PWUD are often members of networks defined by social, sexual, and drug-use partnerships and their receipt of interventions can affect other members in their network. For example, HIV interventions with possible spillover include educational training about HIV risk reduction, pre-exposure prophylaxis, or treatment as prevention. In turn, intervention effects frequently depend on the network structure, and intervention coverage levels and spillover can occur even if not measured in a study, possibly resulting in an underestimation of intervention effects. Recent methodological approaches were developed to assess spillover in the context of network-based studies. This tutorial provides an overview of different study designs for network-based studies and related methodological approaches for assessing spillover in each design. We also provide an overview of other important methodological issues in network studies, including causal influence in networks and missing data. Finally, we highlight applications of different designs and methods from studies of PWUD and conclude with an illustrative example from the Transmission Reduction Intervention Project (TRIP) in Athens, Greece.

AB  - We developed an agent-based model using a trial emulation approach to quantify effect measure modification of spillover effects of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV among men who have sex with men (MSM) in the Atlanta-Sandy Springs-Roswell metropolitan area, Georgia. PrEP may impact not only the individual prescribed, but also their partners and beyond, known as spillover. We simulated a two-stage randomised trial with eligible components (≥3 agents with ≥1 HIV+ agent) first randomised to intervention or control (no PrEP). Within intervention components, agents were randomised to PrEP with coverage of 70%, providing insight into a high PrEP coverage strategy. We evaluated effect modification by component-level characteristics and estimated spillover effects on HIV incidence using an extension of randomisation-based estimators. We observed an attenuation of the spillover effect when agents were in components with a higher prevalence of either drug use or bridging potential (if an agent acts as a mediator between ≥2 connected groups of agents). The estimated spillover effects were larger in magnitude among components with either higher HIV prevalence or greater density (number of existing partnerships compared to all possible partnerships). Consideration of effect modification is important when evaluating the spillover of PrEP among MSM.

AB  - Implementation trials often involve clustering via risk networks, where only some participants directly receive the intervention. The individual effect is that among directly treated persons beyond being in an intervention network; the disseminated effect is that among persons engaged with those directly treated. In this article, we employ a causal inference framework and discuss assumptions and estimators for individual and disseminated effects and apply them to the HIV Prevention Trials Network 037 Study. HIV Prevention Trials Network 037 was a phase III, network-level, randomized controlled human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention trial conducted in the United States and Thailand from 2002 to 2006 that recruited injection drug users, who were assigned to either an intervention group or a control group, and their risk network members, who received no direct intervention. Combining individual and disseminated effects, we observed a 35% composite rate reduction in the adjusted model (risk ratio = 0.65, 95% confidence interval: 0.47, 0.90). Methodology is now available for estimating the full set of these effects, enhancing knowledge gained from network-randomized trials. Although the overall effect gains validity from network randomization, we show that it will generally be less than the composite effect. Additionally, if only index participants benefit from the intervention, as the network size increases, the overall effect tends toward the null-an unfortunate and misleading conclusion.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Big events (i.e., unique historical disruptions) like the COVID-19 epidemic and its associated period of social distancing can transform social structures, social interactions, and social norms. Social distancing rules and the fear of infection have greatly reduced face-to-face interactions, increased loneliness, reduced ties to helping institutions, and may also have disrupted the opioid use behaviors of people who use drugs. This research used Reddit to examine the impact of COVID-19 on the social networks and social processes of people who use opioids. METHODS: Data were collected from the social media forum, Reddit.com. At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. (March 5, 2020, to May 13, 2020), 2,000 Reddit posts were collected from the two most popular opioid subreddits (r/OpiatesRecovery, r/Opiates). Posts were reviewed for relevance to COVID-19 and opioid use resulting in a final sample of 300. Thematic analysis was guided by the Big Events framework. RESULTS: The COVID-19 pandemic was found to create changes in the social networks and daily lives among persons who use opioids. Adaptions to these changes shifted social networks leading to robust social support and mutual aid on Reddit, including sharing and seeking advice on facing withdrawal, dealing with isolation, managing cravings, and accessing recovery resources. CONCLUSIONS: Reddit provided an important source of social support and mutual aid for persons who use opioids. Findings indicate online social support networks are beneficial to persons who use opioids, particularly during big events where isolation from other social support resources may occur.

AB  - Antibodies to several epitopes of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope glycoprotein (gp120-gp41) can synergize in inhibiting HIV-1 infection. In the present study we tested the ability of a monoclonal antibody (MAb), 5A8, which interacts with CD4 domain 2, and other CD4-specific MAbs to synergize with antibodies against gp120. We have previously found that 5A8 inhibits HIV-1 entry without interfering with gp120 binding to CD4, presumably by affecting a postbinding membrane fusion event. Because antibodies to the gp120 V3 loop also affect post-CD4-gp120-binding events, 5A8 was first tested in combination with anti-V3 loop antibodies for possible synergy. The anti-V3 loop antibodies 0.5 beta, NEA-9205, and 110.5 acted synergistically with 5A8 in inhibiting syncytium formation between gp120-gp41- and CD4-expressing cells. A human MAb to an epitope of gp120 involved in CD4 binding, IAM 120-1B1, and another anti-CD4 binding site antibody, PC39.13, also exerted synergistic effects in combination with 5A8. Similarly, an antibody against the gp120 binding site on CD4, 6H10, acted synergistically with an anti-V3 loop antibody, NEA-9205. However, a control anti-CD4 antibody, OKT4, which does not significantly inhibit syncytium formation alone, produced only an additive effect when combined with NEA-9205. Serum from HIV-1-infected individuals, which presumably contains antibodies to the V3 loop and the CD4 binding site, exhibited a strong synergistic effect with 5A8 in inhibiting infection by a patient HIV-1 isolate (0104B) and in blocking syncytium formation. These results indicate that therapeutics based on antibodies affecting both non-gp120 binding and gp120 binding epitopes of the target receptor molecule, CD4, could be efficient in patients who already contain anti-gp120 antibodies and could also be used to enhance passive immunization against HIV-1 in combination with anti-gp120 antibodies.

AB  - In 1984 as part of a New York City study to examine the prevalence of HIV infection in a substance-abusing population and to test the validity of HIV screening kits, 94 patients at the New York VAMC were tested. Results were made available to 50 (35 seronegative, 15 seropositive) patients in January 1986. Psychological and behavioral impact of learning test results was assessed using standardized psychiatric rating scales. A comparison group of 31 nontested subjects were also evaluated. Ratings were done preresults, approximately 1-2 weeks after results, and 8-10 weeks after informing patients of their HIV status. No major stress reactions were observed. Seropositives experienced a higher level of anxiety 1-2 weeks after learning results but anxiety generally diminished; they made significant behavior changes which were maintained. Seronegatives experienced relief and maintained IV drug risk reduction behavior. Anxiety about contracting AIDS increased in nontested subjects as the study progressed.

AB  - Preventing illicit drug injection would be the ideal point for preventing HIV infection and AIDS among illicit drug injectors. This paper reports on clinical issues that arose in a program for intranasal ("sniffer") heroin users who were at high risk of injecting drugs. Extensive field notes were kept by the staff of the project. A generalized mistrust of authorities, denial of problems associated with non-injected drug use, and ambivalence about injecting were the major issues that arose during subject recruitment and the group sessions. The staff underwent trial and error learning, both becoming more confident in working with heroin sniffers, and finding better results for later participants in the study.

AB  - More than 750,000 people in the United States died from an overdose between 1999 and 2018; two-thirds of those deaths involved an opioid. In this review, we present trends in opioid overdose rates during this period and discuss how the proliferation of opioid prescribing to treat chronic pain, changes in the heroin and illegally manufactured opioid synthetics markets, and social factors, including deindustrialization and concentrated poverty, contributed to the rise of the overdose epidemic. We also examine how current policies implemented to address the overdose epidemic may have contributed to reducing prescription opioid overdoses but increased overdoses involving illegal opioids. Finally, we identify new directions for research to understand the causes and solutions to this critical public health problem, including research on heterogeneous policy effects across social groups, effective approaches to reduce overdoses of illegal opioids, and the role of social contexts in shaping policy implementation and impact.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To interrogate the circulating SARS-CoV-2 lin-eages and recombinant variants in persons living in migrant shelters and persons who inject drugs (PWID). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We combined data from two studies with marginalized populations (migrants in shelters and persons who inject drugs) in Tijuana, Mexico. SARS-CoV-2 variants were identified on nasal swabs specimens and compared to publicly available genomes sampled in Mexico and California. RESULTS: All but 2 of the 10 lineages identified were predomi-nantly detected in North and Central America. Discrepan-cies between migrants and PWID can be explained by the temporal emergence and short time span of most of these lineages in the region. CONCLUSION: The results illustrate the temporo-spatial structure for SARS-CoV-2 lineage dispersal and the potential co-circulation of multiple lineages in high-risk populations with close social contacts. These conditions create the potential for recombination to take place in the California-Baja California border.

AB  - Young injection drug users (IDUs) are at risk for acquiring blood-borne diseases like HIV and Hepatitis C. Little is known about the population prevalence of young IDUs. We (1) estimate annual population prevalence rates of young IDUs (aged 15-29) per 10,000 in 95 large U.S. metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) from 1992 to 2002; (2) assess the validity of these estimates; and (3) explore whether injection drug use among youth in these MSAs began to rise after HAART was discovered. A linear mixed model (LMM) estimated the annual population prevalence of young IDUs in each MSA and described trends therein. The population prevalence of IDUs among youths across 95 MSAs increased from 1996 (mean = 95.64) to 2002 (mean = 115.59). Additional analyses of the proportion of young IDUs using health services suggest this increase may have continued after 2002. Harm reduction and prevention research and programs for young IDUs are needed.

AB  - Objectives: Very few studies in Canada address the sexual health of young Aboriginal people who use drugs; the focus in established literature has been on parenteral risks. This study sought to identify the risk factors associated with inconsistent condom use in a cohort of young Aboriginal people who live in British Columbia and use drugs. Methods: This analysis includes baseline questionnaire data from October 2003 to April 2005. Multivariable modeling stratified by gender identified independent demographic, traumatic, sex and drug use risk factors associated with inconsistent condom use. Results: Of the 292 women and 313 men at baseline, prevalence of inconsistent condom use during insertive sex was 59% and 46%, respectively. In multivariable logistic regression, after adjusting for age and location, inconsistent condom use among women was significantly associated with ever being enrolled in a drug/alcohol treatment program (AOR: 1.95, 95% CI: 1.06-3.60), and ever being sexually abused (AOR: 1.80, 95% CI: 1.01-3.20). Among men, inconsistent condom use was significantly associated with having more than 20 lifetime sex partners (AOR: 2.06, 95% CI: 1.24-3.44). Conclusion: Our study demonstrates high rates of inconsistent condom use among young Aboriginal people who use drugs, highlighting their vulnerability to contracting sexually transmitted infections. Culturally tailored sexual health interventions must be made a priority and need to incorporate the reality of gendered differences in the context of multigenerational trauma, including non-consensual sex.

AB  - Background: Prescription opioid use (POU) among young adults is increasing. This represents a major public health concern due to the increased risks of opioid use misuse and opioid-related overdose. Limited research has examined the POU among young black men who have sex with men (YBMSM), a diverse group experiencing continued increases in HIV incidence over the past decade. Objective: This study aims to examine the prevalence and both the individual and network characteristics of POU among YBMSM. Methods: Data were from a longitudinal cohort study of 16-29 year old YBMSM (N = 514) between 2013 and 2016 in Chicago. Bivariate and multivariable associations were estimated using general estimating equations (GEE). Results: Approximately 4.2% of YBMSM reported POU in the past 12 months with a cumulative incidence rate of 4.1% over the 18-month follow-up period. YBMSM having criminal justice involvements, experiencing violence, or using any illicit drug other than marijuana in the past 12 months were more likely to report POU in the past 12 months. The presence of a mother figure, however, was associated with a decreased risk of POU in the past 12 months, while engaging in condomless anal sex with their named sexual partners was associated with an increased risk of POU in the past 12 months. Conclusions: This is one of the first studies to describe POU among a population-based sample of YBMSM. The high incidence rate of POU among YBMSM is alarming, and it underscores the need for further analysis on POU among this key population.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To provide pilot data on the safety and efficacy of anterior and posterior sub-Tenon injections of triamcinolone either alone or in combination with focal photocoagulation in the treatment of mild diabetic macular edema (DME). DESIGN: Prospective, phase II, multicenter, randomized clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred nine patients (129 eyes) with mild DME and visual acuity 20/40 or better. METHODS: The participants were assigned randomly to receive either focal photocoagulation (n = 38), a 20-mg anterior sub-Tenon injection of triamcinolone (n = 23), a 20-mg anterior sub-Tenon injection followed by focal photocoagulation after 4 weeks (n = 25), a 40-mg posterior sub-Tenon injection of triamcinolone (n = 21), or a 40-mg posterior sub-Tenon injection followed by focal photocoagulation after 4 weeks (n = 22). Follow-up visits were performed at 4, 8, 17, and 34 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Change in visual acuity and retinal thickness measured with optical coherence tomography (OCT). RESULTS: At baseline, mean visual acuity in the study eyes was 20/25 and mean OCT central subfield thickness was 328 mum. Changes in retinal thickening and in visual acuity were not significantly different among the 5 groups at 34 weeks (P = 0.46 and P = 0.94, respectively). There was a suggestion of a greater proportion of eyes having a central subfield thickness less than 250 mum at 17 weeks when the peribulbar triamcinolone was combined with focal photocoagulation. Elevated intraocular pressure and ptosis were adverse effects attributable to the injections. CONCLUSIONS: In cases of DME with good visual acuity, peribulbar triamcinolone, with or without focal photocoagulation, is unlikely to be of substantial benefit. Based on these results, a phase III trial to evaluate the benefit of these treatments for mild DME is not warranted.

AB  - OBJECTIVE AND DESIGN: We investigated anti-inflammatory properties of a novel 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) inhibitor, KRH-102140, in vitro and in vivo. 5-LO enzyme activity was assayed using insect cell lysates overexpressing rat 5-LO. The leukotriene B(4) (LTB(4)) level was assayed in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-1) cell line. ICR (Institute of Cancer Research) mice were used for in vivo assays. Mouse ear edema was induced by topical application of arachidonic acid. An air pouch was induced by subcutaneous injection of sterile air into mice, followed by zymosan treatment. Sprague-Dawley rats were used for pharmacokinetic studies. RESULTS: KRH-102140 inhibited 5-LO activity with an IC(50) value of 160 ± 23 nmol/l in parallel with LTB(4) inhibition in RBL-1 cells. Oral administration of KRH-102140 (10-100 mg/kg) reduced ear edema, myeloperoxidase activity and LTB(4) production in murine inflammation models. Oral bioavailability as determined in rats was 66%. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that KRH-102140, a new 5-LO inhibitor, exhibits potent anti-inflammatory activities in vitro as well as in vivo.

AB  - BACKGROUND: While online health social networks (OHSNs) serve as an effective platform for patients to fulfill their various social support needs, predicting the needs of users and providing tailored information remains a challenge. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to discriminate important features for identifying users' social support needs based on knowledge gathered from survey data. This study also provides guidelines for a technical framework, which can be used to predict users' social support needs based on raw data collected from OHSNs. METHODS: We initially conducted a Web-based survey with 184 OHSN users. From this survey data, we extracted 34 features based on 5 categories: (1) demographics, (2) reading behavior, (3) posting behavior, (4) perceived roles in OHSNs, and (5) values sought in OHSNs. Features from the first 4 categories were used as variables for binary classification. For the prediction outcomes, we used features from the last category: the needs for emotional support, experience-based information, unconventional information, and medical facts. We compared 5 binary classifier algorithms: gradient boosting tree, random forest, decision tree, support vector machines, and logistic regression. We then calculated the scores of the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) to understand the comparative effectiveness of the used features. RESULTS: The best performance was AUC scores of 0.89 for predicting users seeking emotional support, 0.86 for experience-based information, 0.80 for unconventional information, and 0.83 for medical facts. With the gradient boosting tree as our best performing model, we analyzed the strength of individual features in predicting one's social support need. Among other discoveries, we found that users seeking emotional support tend to post more in OHSNs compared with others. CONCLUSIONS: We developed an initial framework for automatically predicting social support needs in OHSNs using survey data. Future work should involve nonsurvey data to evaluate the feasibility of the framework. Our study contributes to providing personalized social support in OHSNs.

AB  - Bangkok experienced an extremely rapid spread of HIV infection among drug injectors in 1987 and 1988. This study examines risk factors for HIV infection and deliberate risk-reduction efforts by drug injectors. Two subsamples of injecting drug users were recruited in November 1989, a group in drug-use treatment (n = 342) and a group new to the treatment system (n = 259). Subjects were interviewed about AIDS risk behavior, and a blood sample was collected for HIV testing. Seroprevalence was 39 and 27% in the in-treatment sample and the new-to-treatment sample, respectively. The in-treatment sample seroprevalence rate is similar to rates observed 6 and 12 months earlier. Three factors were independently associated with HIV infection: subsample, having been in prison, and sharing injection equipment with two or more individuals in the previous 6 months. Deliberate risk reduction was reported by 92% of individuals, with 59% reporting that they had stopped sharing injection equipment. It appears that large-scale risk reduction has greatly slowed HIV transmission among drug injectors in Bangkok.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The prognostic value of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid analysis in non-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients with Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) has not been well elucidated. We aimed to investigate the prognostic implication of BAL fluid analysis in non-HIV patients with PJP. METHODS: The data of 178 non-HIV patients diagnosed with PJP based on the results of the polymerase chain reaction assay of BAL fluid specimens between April 2018 and December 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. The clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, and BAL fluid analysis results of patients who died within 90 days after hospital admission were compared. RESULTS: Twenty patients (11.2%) died within 90 days from admission. The neutrophil count in BAL fluid was significantly higher (median 22.0%, interquartile range [IQR] 2.0-46.0% vs. median 6.0%, IQR 2.0-18.0%, P = 0.044), while the lymphocyte count was significantly lower (median 24.0%, IQR 7.0-37.0% vs. median 41.0%, IQR 22.5-60.5%, P = 0.001) in the non-survivor group compared with that in the survivor group. In the multivariate analysis, the C-reactive protein level (odds ratio [OR] 1.093, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.020-1.170, P = 0.011) and a BAL fluid lymphocyte count of ≤ 30% (OR 3.353, 95% CI 1.101-10.216, P = 0.033) were independently associated with mortality after adjusting for albumin and lactate dehydrogenase levels. CONCLUSION: A low lymphocyte count in BAL fluid may be a predictor of mortality in non-HIV patients with PJP.

AB  - This ecologic cohort study explores the relationship between state minimum wage laws and rates of HIV diagnoses among heterosexual black residents of U.S metropolitan areas over an 8-year span. Specifically, we applied hierarchical linear modeling to investigate whether state-level variations in minimum wage laws, adjusted for cost-of-living and inflation, were associated with rates of new HIV diagnoses among heterosexual black residents of metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs; n=73), between 2008 and 2015. Findings suggest that an inverse relationship exists between baseline state minimum wages and initial rates of newly diagnosed HIV cases among heterosexual black individuals, after adjusting for potential confounders. MSAs with a minimum wage that was $1 higher at baseline had a 27.12% lower rate of newly diagnosed HIV cases. Exploratory analyses suggest that income inequality may mediate this relationship. If subsequent research establishes a causal relationship between minimum wage and this outcome, efforts to increase minimum wages should be incorporated into HIV prevention strategies for this vulnerable population.

AB  - This study tests the effect of neighborhood changes on gonorrhea rates. Prior studies that indicate gonorrhea rates are associated with alcohol outlet density and neighborhood deterioration have been cross-sectional and cannot establish causality. After the 1992 Civil Unrest in Los Angeles, 270 alcohol outlets surrendered their licenses due to arson and vandalism thus providing a natural experiment. We geocoded all reported gonorrhea cases from 1988 to 1996 in LA County, all annually licensed alcohol outlets, and all properties damaged as a result of the civil unrest. We ran individual growth models to examine the independent effects of changes in alcohol outlets and damaged buildings on gonorrhea. The individual growth model explained over 90% of the residual variance in census tract gonorrhea rates. After the civil unrest, a unit decrease in the number of alcohol outlets per mile of roadway was associated with 21 fewer gonorrhea cases per 100,000 (p<.01) in tracts affected by the Unrest compared to those not affected. Neighborhood alcohol outlets appear to be significantly associated with changes in gonorrhea rates. The findings suggest that efforts to control sexually transmitted diseases, including gonorrhea and HIV, should address contextual factors that facilitate high-risk behaviors and disease transmission.

AB  - Black and Latino sexual minority men (SMM) continue to be disproportionately impacted by HIV. We utilized eight components of the Meaningful Involvement of People Living with HIV/AIDS (MIPA) framework to assess the engagement of Black and Latino SMM. Thirty-six (36) studies were included in the literature review. Forty-two percent of studies were Black SMM-specific, followed by Latino SMM-specific (31%) studies. Twenty-eight percent of studies were conducted among both groups. Most studies (72%) were intervention-related and focused on HIV prevention. The top five most common methods of community engagement were focus groups (39%), followed by interviews (36%), community-based participatory research (14%), the utilization of community advisory boards or peer mentorship (11%), and the establishment of multi-stakeholder coalitions, observations, or surveys (8%). We documented at least 7 MIPA components in 47% of the included studies. Community-based participatory research was more commonly utilized to engage Latino SMM. Researchers were more likely to initiate the engagement across all included studies. Few studies documented how Black and Latino SMM perceived the engagement. Engagement responsiveness was a well-documented MIPA component. In terms of engagement power dynamics, there were several examples of power imbalances, especially among Black SMM-specific studies. The inclusion of Black and Latino SMM had robust impacts on HIV research and interventions. There were limited examples of engagement capacity and maintenance. This is one of the first studies focused on utilizing MIPA to document the engagement of SMM of color. MIPA served as a useful framework for understanding the engagement of SMM of color in the US HIV response. The engagement of SMM of color is critical to reducing health inequities.

AB  - Increasing sterile syringe access for injection drug users (IDUs) is one way to prevent HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) transmission in this population. In 2005, California Senate Bill 1159 allowed counties to adopt the Disease Prevention Demonstration Project (DPDP). Where enacted, the DPDP allows pharmacies that register with the county to sell up to ten syringes to adults without a prescription. In the current study, we describe pharmacy participation in nonprescription syringe sales (NPSS) in two counties in California and examine factors associated with NPSS. Telephone and in-person interviews were conducted in Los Angeles (LA) and San Francisco (SF) with 238 pharmacies in 2007 (n = 67 in SF; n = 171 in LA). Quantitative survey items captured pharmacy registration with the county, pharmacy policies/practices, episodes and conditions of NPSS and refusals to sell, potential negative consequences of NPSS, and staff attitudes regarding HIV and HCV prevention for IDUs. Overall, 42% of pharmacies reported NPSS (28% in LA and 81% in SF), although only 34% had registered with the county (17% in LA and 76% in SF). Many pharmacies required proof of a medical condition (80% in LA and 30% in SF) and refused NPSS if the customer was a suspected IDU (74% in LA, 33% in SF). Few negative consequences of NPSS were reported. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, we found that the odds of NPSS were significantly higher among pharmacists who thought syringe access was important for preventing HIV among IDUs [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 2.95; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.10-7.92], were chain pharmacies (AOR = 12.5; 95% CI = 4.55-33.33), and were located in SF (AOR = 4.88; 95% CI = 1.94-12.28). These results suggest that NPSS were influenced by pharmacists' perception. NPSS might be increased through greater educational efforts directed at pharmacists, particularly those in non-chain pharmacies.

AB  - Despite the 2010 repeal of the ban on spending federal monies to fund syringe exchange programs (SEPs) in the U.S.A., these interventions--and specifically SEP site locations--remain controversial. To further inform discussions about the location of SEP sites, this longitudinal multilevel study investigates the relationship between spatial access to sterile syringes distributed by SEPs in New York City (NYC) United Hospital Fund (UHF) districts and injecting with an unsterile syringe among injectors over time (1995-2006). Annual measures of spatial access to syringes in each UHF district (N = 42) were created using data on SEP site locations and site-specific syringe distribution data. Individual-level data on unsterile injecting among injectors (N = 4,067) living in these districts, and on individual-level covariates, were drawn from the Risk Factors study, an ongoing cross-sectional study of NYC drug users. We used multilevel models to explore the relationship of district-level access to syringes to the odds of injecting with an unsterile syringe in >75% of injection events in the past 6 months, and to test whether this relationship varied by district-level arrest rates (per 1,000 residents) for drug and drug paraphernalia possession. The relationship between district-level access to syringes and the odds of injecting with an unsterile syringe depended on district-level arrest rates. In districts with low baseline arrest rates, better syringe access was associated with a decline in the odds of frequently injecting with an unsterile syringe (AOR, 0.95). In districts with no baseline syringe access, higher arrest rates were associated with increased odds of frequently injecting with an unsterile syringe (AOR, 1.02) When both interventions were present, arrest rates eroded the protective effects of spatial access to syringes. Spatial access to syringes in small geographic areas appears to reduce the odds of injecting with an unsterile syringe among local injectors, and arrest rates elevate these odds. Policies and practices that curtail syringe flow in geographic areas (e.g., restrictions on SEP locations or syringe distribution) or that make it difficult for injectors to use the sterile syringes they have acquired may damage local injectors' efforts to reduce HIV transmission and other injection-related harms.

AB  - PURPOSE: Because blacks and Latinos bear a disproportionate burden of injection-related health problems compared with whites, we sought to describe black/white and Latino/white disparities in injecting drugs in 94 US metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) in 1998. METHODS: Using US Census data and three databases documenting injectors' use of different healthcare services (drug treatment, HIV counseling and testing, and AIDS diagnoses), we calculated database-specific black/white and Latino/white disparities in injecting in each MSA and created an index of black/white and Latino/white disparities by averaging data across the three databases. RESULTS: The median black/white injecting disparity in the MSAs ranged from 1.4 to 3.7 across the three databases; corresponding median Latino/white injecting disparities ranged from 1.0 to 1.1. Median black/white and Latino/white index disparity values were 2.6 and 1.0, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Although whites were the majority of injectors in most MSAs, database-specific and index black/white disparity scores indicate that blacks were more likely to inject than whites. While database-specific and index disparity scores indicate that Latinos and whites had similar injecting rates, they also revealed considerable variation in disparities across MSAs. Future research should investigate these disparities' causes, including racial/ethnic inequality and discrimination, and study their contributions to the disproportionate burden of injection-related health problems borne by blacks and Latinos.

AB  - The concept of the "risk environment"--defined as the "space ... [where] factors exogenous to the individual interact to increase the chances of HIV transmission"--draws together the disciplines of public health and geography. Researchers have increasingly turned to geographic methods to quantify dimensions of the risk environment that are both structural and spatial (e.g., local poverty rates). The scientific power of the intersection between public health and geography, however, has yet to be fully mined. In particular, research on the risk environment has rarely applied geographic methods to create neighbourhood-based measures of syringe exchange programmes (SEPs) or of drug-related law enforcement activities, despite the fact that these interventions are widely conceptualized as structural and spatial in nature and are two of the most well-established dimensions of the risk environment. To strengthen research on the risk environment, this paper presents a way of using geographic methods to create neighbourhood-based measures of (1) access to SEP sites and (2) exposure to drug-related arrests, and then applies these methods to one setting (New York City [NYC]). NYC-based results identified substantial cross-neighbourhood variation in SEP site access and in exposure to drug-related arrest rates (even within the subset of neighbourhoods nominally experiencing the same drug-related police strategy). These geographic measures--grounded as they are in conceptualizations of SEPs and drug-related law enforcement strategies--can help develop new arenas of inquiry regarding the impact of these two dimensions of the risk environment on injectors' health, including exploring whether and how neighbourhood-level access to SEP sites and exposure to drug-related arrests shape a range of outcomes among local injectors.

AB  - Pharmacies that sell over-the-counter (OTC) syringes are a major source of sterile syringes for injection drug users in cities and states where such sales are legal. In these cities and states, however, black injectors are markedly less likely to acquire syringes from pharmacies than white injectors. The present analysis documents spatial and temporal trends in OTC pharmacy access in New York City health districts over time (2001-2006) and investigates whether these trends are related to district racial/ethnic composition and to local need for OTC pharmacies. For each year of the study period, we used kernel density estimation methods to characterize spatial access to OTC pharmacies within each health district. Higher values on this measure indicate better access to these pharmacies. "Need" was operationalized using two different measures: the number of newly diagnosed injection-related AIDS cases per 10,000 residents (averaged across 1999-2001), and the number of drug-related hospital discharges per 10,000 residents (averaged across 1999-2001). District sociodemographic characteristics were assessed using 2000 US decennial census data. We used hierarchical linear models (HLM) for descriptive and inferential analyses and investigated whether the relationship between need and temporal trajectories in the Expanded Syringe Access Demonstration Program access varied by district racial/ethnic composition, controlling for district poverty rates. HLM analyses indicate that the mean spatial access to OTC pharmacies across New York City health districts was 12.71 in 2001 and increased linearly by 1.32 units annually thereafter. Temporal trajectories in spatial access to OTC pharmacies depended on both need and racial/ethnic composition. Within high-need districts, OTC pharmacy access was twice as high in 2001 and increased three times faster annually, in districts with higher proportions of non-Hispanic white residents than in districts with low proportions of these residents. In low-need districts, "whiter" districts had substantially greater baseline access to OTC pharmacies than districts with low proportions of non-Hispanic white residents. Access remained stable thereafter in low-need districts, regardless of racial/ethnic composition. Conclusions were consistent across both measures of "need" and persisted after controlling for local poverty rates. In both high- and low-need districts, spatial access to OTC pharmacies was greater in "Whiter" districts in 2001; in high-need districts, access also increased more rapidly over time in "whiter" districts. Ensuring equitable spatial access to OTC pharmacies may reduce injection-related HIV transmission overall and reduce racial/ethnic disparities in HIV incidence among injectors.

AB  - Infective endocarditis is a potentially fatal consequence of illicit injection drug use. We estimate that the number of hospitalization for injection drug use-related infective endocarditis increased by 38%-66% in the United States between 2000-2001 and 2002-2003, a period during which the number of at-risk persons (i.e., injection drug users) remained stable. Increasing methamphetamine use and/or drug injection frequency may have increased the incidence of infective endocarditis among active injection drug users.

AB  - No adequate data exist on patterns of injection drug use (IDU) prevalence over time within racial/ethnic groups in U.S. geographic areas. The absence of such prevalence data limits our understanding of the causes and consequences of IDU and hampers planning efforts for IDU-related interventions. Here, we (1) describe a method of estimating IDU prevalence among non-Hispanic Black and non-Hispanic White adult residents of 95 large U.S. metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) annually over an 11-year period (1992--2002); (2) validate the resulting prevalence estimates; and (3) document temporal trends in these prevalence estimates. IDU prevalence estimates for Black adults were calculated in several steps: we (1) created estimates of the proportion of injectors who were Black in each MSA and year by analyzing databases documenting injectors' encounters with the healthcare system; (2) multiplied the resulting proportions by previously calculated estimates of the total number of injectors in each MSA and year (Brady et al., 2008); (3) divided the result by the number of Black adults living in each MSA each year; and (4) validated the resulting estimates by correlating them cross-sectionally with theoretically related constructs (Black- and White-specific prevalences of drug-related mortality and of mortality from hepatitis C). We used parallel methods to estimate and validate White IDU prevalence. We analyzed trends in the resulting racial/ethnic-specific IDU prevalence estimates using measures of central tendency and hierarchical linear models (HLM). Black IDU prevalence declined from a median of 279 injectors per 10,000 adults in 1992 to 156 injectors per 10,000 adults in 2002. IDU prevalence for White adults remained relatively flat over time (median values ranged between 86 and 97 injectors per 10,000 adults). HLM analyses described similar trends and suggest that declines in Black IDU prevalence decelerated over time. Both sets of IDU estimates correlated cross-sectionally adequately with validators, suggesting that they have acceptable convergent validity (range for Black IDU prevalence validation: 0.27 < r < 0.61; range for White IDU prevalence: 0.38 < r < 0.80). These data give insight, for the first time, into IDU prevalence trends among Black adults and White adults in large U.S. MSAs. The decline seen here for Black adults may partially explain recent reductions in newly reported cases of IDU-related HIV evident in surveillance data on this population. Declining Black IDU prevalence may have been produced by (1) high AIDS-related mortality rates among Black injectors in the 1990s, rates lowered by the advent of HAART; (2) reduced IDU incidence among Black drug users; and/or (3) MSA-level social processes (e.g., diminishing residential segregation). The stability of IDU prevalence among White adults between 1992 and 2002 may be a function of lower AIDS-related mortality rates in this population; relative stability (and perhaps increases in some MSAs) in initiating IDU among White drug users; and social processes. Future research should investigate the extent to which these racial/ethnic-specific IDU prevalence trends (1) explain, and are explained by, recent trends in IDU-related health outcomes, and (2) are determined by MSA-level social processes.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We examined relationships of spatial access to syringe exchange programs (SEPs) and pharmacies selling over-the-counter (OTC) syringes with New York City drug injectors' harm reduction practices. METHODS: Each year from 1995 to 2006, we measured the percentage of 42 city health districts' surface area that was within 1 mile of an SEP or OTC pharmacy. We applied hierarchical generalized linear models to investigate relationships between these exposures and the odds that injectors (n = 4003) used a sterile syringe for at least 75% of injections in the past 6 months. RESULTS: A 1-unit increase in the natural log of the percentage of a district's surface area within a mile of an SEP in 1995 was associated with a 26% increase in the odds of injecting with a sterile syringe; a 1-unit increase in this exposure over time increased these odds 23%. A 1-unit increase in the natural log of OTC pharmacy access improved these odds 15%. CONCLUSIONS: Greater spatial access to SEPs and OTC pharmacies improved injectors' capacity to engage in harm reduction practices that reduce HIV and HCV transmission.

AB  - Drug-related law enforcement activities may undermine the protective effects of syringe exchange programs (SEPs) on local injectors' risk of injection-related infections. We explored the spatial overlap of drug-related arrest rates and access to SEPs over time (1995-2006) in New York City health districts, and used multilevel models to investigate the relationship of these two district-level exposures to the odds of injecting with an unsterile syringe. Districts with better SEP access had higher arrest rates, and arrest rates undermined SEPs' protective relationship with unsterile injecting. Drug-related enforcement strategies targeting drug users should be de-emphasized in areas surrounding SEPs.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We analyzed the relations of two 1990 dimensions of racial residential segregation (isolation and concentration) with 1998 injection drug use prevalence among Black adult residents of 93 large US metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs). METHODS: We estimated injection drug use prevalence among Black adults in each MSA by analyzing 3 databases documenting injection drug users' encounters with the health care system. Multiple linear regression methods were used to investigate the relationship of isolation and concentration to the natural logarithm of Black adult injection drug use prevalence, controlling for possible confounders. RESULTS: The median injection drug use prevalence was 1983 per 100000 Black adults (interquartile range: 1422 to 2759 per 100000). The median isolation index was 0.48 (range: 0.05 to 0.84): in half the MSAs studied, the average Black resident inhabited a census tract where 48% or more of the residents were Black. The multiple regression model indicates that an increase of 0.50 in the isolation index was associated with a 23% increase in injection drug use prevalence among Black adults. Concentration was unrelated to the outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Residential isolation is positively related to Black injection drug use prevalence in MSAs. Research into the pathways linking isolation to injection drug use is needed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Substantial racial/ethnic disparities exist in HIV infection among people who inject drugs (PWID) in many countries. To strengthen efforts to understand the causes of disparities in HIV-related outcomes and eliminate them, we expand the "Risk Environment Model" to encompass the construct "racialized risk environments," and investigate whether PWID risk environments in the United States are racialized. Specifically, we investigate whether black and Latino PWID are more likely than white PWID to live in places that create vulnerability to adverse HIV-related outcomes. METHODS: As part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National HIV Behavioral Surveillance, 9170 PWID were sampled from 19 metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) in 2009. Self-reported data were used to ascertain PWID race/ethnicity. Using Census data and other administrative sources, we characterized features of PWID risk environments at four geographic scales (i.e., ZIP codes, counties, MSAs, and states). Means for each feature of the risk environment were computed for each racial/ethnic group of PWID, and were compared across racial/ethnic groups. RESULTS: Almost universally across measures, black PWID were more likely than white PWID to live in environments associated with vulnerability to adverse HIV-related outcomes. Compared to white PWID, black PWID lived in ZIP codes with higher poverty rates and worse spatial access to substance abuse treatment and in counties with higher violent crime rates. Black PWID were less likely to live in states with laws facilitating sterile syringe access (e.g., laws permitting over-the-counter syringe sales). Latino/white differences in risk environments emerged at the MSA level (e.g., Latino PWID lived in MSAs with higher drug-related arrest rates). CONCLUSION: PWID risk environments in the US are racialized. Future research should explore the implications of this racialization for racial/ethnic disparities in HIV-related outcomes, using appropriate methods.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: We analyzed relationships between place characteristics and being HIV-negative among black, Latino, and white people who inject drugs (PWID) in the US. METHODS: Data on PWID (N = 9077) were from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 2009 National HIV Behavioral Surveillance. Administrative data were analyzed to describe the 968 ZIP codes, 51 counties, and 19 metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) where they lived. Multilevel multivariable models examined relationships between place characteristics and HIV status. Exploratory population attributable risk percents (e-PAR%s) were estimated. RESULTS: Black and Latino PWID were more likely to be HIV-negative if they lived in less economically disadvantaged counties, or in MSAs with less criminal-justice activity (i.e., lower drug-related arrest rates, lower policing/corrections expenditures). Latino PWID were more likely to be HIV-negative in MSAs with more Latino isolation, less black isolation, and less violent crime. E-PAR%s attributed 8-19% of HIV cases among black PWID and 1-15% of cases among Latino PWID to place characteristics. DISCUSSION: Evaluations of structural interventions to improve economic conditions and reduce drug-related criminal justice activity may show evidence that they protect black and Latino PWID from HIV infection.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine whether contextual factors shape injection drug use among Black adolescents and adults. METHODS: For this longitudinal study of 95 US metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs), we drew annual MSA-specific estimates of the prevalence of injection drug use (IDU) among Black adolescents and adults in 1993 through 2007 from 3 surveillance databases. We used existing administrative data to measure MSA-level socioeconomic status; criminal justice activities; expenditures on social welfare, health, and policing; and histories of Black uprisings (1960-1969) and urban renewal funding (1949-1974). We regressed Black IDU prevalence on these predictors by using hierarchical linear models. RESULTS: Black IDU prevalence was lower in MSAs with declining Black high-school dropout rates, a history of Black uprisings, higher percentages of Black residents, and, in MSAs where 1992 White income was high, higher 1992 Black income. Incarceration rates were unrelated. CONCLUSIONS: Contextual factors shape patterns of drug use among Black individuals. Structural interventions, especially those that improve Black socioeconomic security and political strength, may help reduce IDU among Black adolescents and adults.

AB  - No adequate data exist on patterns of injection drug use (IDU) prevalence over time within racial/ethnic groups in U.S. geographic areas. The absence of such prevalence data limits our understanding of the causes and consequences of IDU and hampers planning efforts for IDU-related interventions. Here, we (1) describe a method of estimating IDU prevalence among non-Hispanic Black and non-Hispanic White adult residents of 95 large U.S. metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) annually over an 11-year period (1992-2002); (2) validate the resulting prevalence estimates; and (3) document temporal trends in these prevalence estimates. IDU prevalence estimates for Black adults were calculated in several steps: we (1) created estimates of the proportion of injectors who were Black in each MSA and year by analyzing databases documenting injectors' encounters with the healthcare system; (2) multiplied the resulting proportions by previously calculated estimates of the total number of injectors in each MSA and year (Brady et al., 2008); (3) divided the result by the number of Black adults living in each MSA each year; and (4) validated the resulting estimates by correlating them cross-sectionally with theoretically related constructs (Black- and White-specific prevalences of drug-related mortality and of mortality from hepatitis C). We used parallel methods to estimate and validate White IDU prevalence. We analyzed trends in the resulting racial/ethnic-specific IDU prevalence estimates using measures of central tendency and hierarchical linear models (HLM). Black IDU prevalence declined from a median of 279 injectors per 10,000 adults in 1992 to 156 injectors per 10,000 adults in 2002. IDU prevalence for White adults remained relatively flat over time (median values ranged between 86 and 97 injectors per 10,000 adults). HLM analyses described similar trends and suggest that declines in Black IDU prevalence decelerated over time. Both sets of IDU estimates correlated cross-sectionally adequately with validators, suggesting that they have acceptable convergent validity (range for Black IDU prevalence validation: 0.27 < r < 0.61; range for White IDU prevalence: 0.38 < r < 0.80). These data give insight, for the first time, into IDU prevalence trends among Black adults and White adults in large U.S. MSAs. The decline seen here for Black adults may partially explain recent reductions in newly reported cases of IDU-related HIV evident in surveillance data on this population. Declining Black IDU prevalence may have been produced by (1) high AIDS-related mortality rates among Black injectors in the 1990s, rates lowered by the advent of HAART; (2) reduced IDU incidence among Black drug users; and/or (3) MSA-level social processes (e.g., diminishing residential segregation). The stability of IDU prevalence among White adults between 1992 and 2002 may be a function of lower AIDS-related mortality rates in this population; relative stability (and perhaps increases in some MSAs) in initiating IDU among White drug users; and social processes. Future research should investigate the extent to which these racial/ethnic-specific IDU prevalence trends (1) explain, and are explained by, recent trends in IDU-related health outcomes, and (2) are determined by MSA-level social processes.

AB  - Tuberculosis (TB) is a rapidly growing problem among injecting drug users (IDU), especially those infected with human immunodeficiency virus. The authors review IDUs' responses to current TB control strategies and discuss the implications of their findings for the proposed implementation of directly observed therapy (DOT), a method for ensuring that patients take prescribed medication. Field workers carried out 210 ethnographic interviews with 68 IDUs in a Brooklyn, NY, community during 1990-93. Case studies suggested that many IDUs are uninformed about TB and often misinformed about their personal TB status. Ethnographic interviews and observations indicated that the threat of TB-related involuntary detainment may lead IDUs to avoid TB diagnostic procedures, treatment for TB, or drug abuse treatment, and to avoid AIDS outreach workers and other health-related services. IDUs who tested positive for the purified protein derivative (PPD) of TB sometimes have left hospitals before definitive diagnoses were made, because of a perceived lack of respectful treatment, fear of detention, or lack of adequate methadone therapy to relieve the symptoms of withdrawal from drugs. Current TB diagnosis and treatment systems are, at best, inadequate. The threat of TB-related detention discourages some IDUs from seeking any type of health care. There is an urgent need to educate IDUs about TB and to educate and sensitize health care providers about the lifestyles of IDUs. DOT may help in servicing this difficult-to-serve population, particularly if techniques are incorporated that have been developed for other successful public health interventions for IDUs.

AB  - Ethnographic and formal social network methods are used to define and situate three categories of injecting drug users - a core, an inner periphery and an outer periphery - in a street-level drug market scene. Different locations in these network structures are shown to be associated with different levels of AIDS risk behaviors and of HIV infection rates. A network perspective helps to understand HIV risks and to devise appropriate interventions.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Since there is limited information concerning caffeine's metabolic effects on the human brain, the authors applied a rapid proton echo-planar spectroscopic imaging technique to dynamically measure regional brain metabolic responses to caffeine ingestion. They specifically measured changes in brain lactate due to the combined effects of caffeine's stimulation of glycolysis and reduction of cerebral blood flow. METHOD: Nine heavy caffeine users and nine caffeine-intolerant individuals, who had previously discontinued or substantially curtailed use of caffeinated products because of associated anxiety and discomforting physiological arousal, were studied at baseline and then during 1 hour following ingestion of caffeine citrate (10 mg/kg). To assess state-trait contributions and the effects of caffeine tolerance, five of the caffeine users were restudied after a 1- to 2-month caffeine holiday. RESULTS: The caffeine-intolerant individuals, but not the regular caffeine users, experienced substantial psychological and physiological distress in response to caffeine ingestion. Significant increases in global and regionally specific brain lactate were observed only among the caffeine-intolerant subjects. Reexposure of the regular caffeine users to caffeine after a caffeine holiday resulted in little or no adverse clinical reaction but significant rises in brain lactate which were of a magnitude similar to that observed for the caffeine-intolerant group. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide direct evidence for the loss of caffeine tolerance in the human brain subsequent to caffeine discontinuation and suggest mechanisms for the phenomenon of caffeine intolerance other than its metabolic effects on elevating brain lactate.

AB  - Patients with familial hypercholesterolemia or statin intolerance are especially challenging to manage since LDL cholesterol levels often remain considerably elevated despite clinicians' best efforts. With statins regarded as first-line pharmacologic therapy by the current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines to reduce LDL cholesterol and cardiovascular risk, there is now a critical need to determine when other agents will play a role beyond maximally tolerated statin therapy and lifestyle changes. In this review, we take a closer look at evolocumab (Repatha(®)), one of the new injectable human monoclonal antibodies to PCSK9 and its efficacy and safety properties from the results of various trials.

AB  - Little attention has focused on generational or age-related differences in human immunodeficiency virus/sexually transmitted infection (HIV/STI) risk behaviors among Black men who have sex with men and women (BMSMW). We examined sexual risk behaviors between BMSMW ages 40 and under compared to over age 40. Analysis was conducted using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-sponsored intervention data among BMSMW in Los Angeles, Chicago, and Philadelphia (n = 546). Pearson's chi-square tests were conducted to evaluate associations between age groups and behavioral outcomes. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the odds of behavioral outcomes by age group, adjusting for sexual orientation and study location, within strata of HIV status. HIV-positive BMSMW over age 40 had 62% reduced odds of having a nonmain female partner of HIV-negative or unknown status compared to those ages 40 and under (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.38, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.15, 0.95). Among HIV-negative BMSMW, the older cohort was associated with greater odds of having condomless insertive anal intercourse (IAI) with most recent main male partner (AOR 2.44, 95% CI = 1.12, 5.32) and having a concurrent partnership while with their recent main female partner (AOR = 2.6, 95% CI = 1.10, 4.67). For both groups, odds of engaging in certain risk behaviors increased with increasing age. Prevention efforts should consider generational differences and age in HIV risks among BMSMW.

AB  - Black men who have sex with men and women (BMSMW) are at high risk for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Despite knowing that HIV/STI risk varies by sexual positioning practices, limited data have characterized the risk profiles of BSMW. This study utilized latent class analysis (LCA) to explore BMSMW's sexual risk profiles regarding condomless sexual positioning practices. Participants were BMSMW in intervention studies in Los Angeles, Chicago, and Philadelphia. LCA was used to characterize their sexual risk profiles. Age, study location, HIV status, social support, and internalized homophobia were used as covariates in a multinomial regression model predicting the likelihood of class membership. Among the 546 participants, three latent classes of risk were identified: Seropositive Serosorters, Seronegative/unknown Serosorters, and Main Partners Only. All groups had the greatest probabilities of condomless sex with main partners. Seropositive Serosorters had the highest probabilities of condomless sex with HIV-positive partners. Seronegative/unknown Serosorters had the highest probabilities of condomless sex with HIV-negative or unknown status partners. HIV-positive BMSMW had 87% lower odds of being classified as Seronegative/unknown Serosorters than Seropositive Serosorters than HIV-negative/unknown status BMSMW (AOR = 0.13, 95% CI 0.06, 0.28). HIV-positive BMSMW had 71% lower odds of being classified as Main Partners Only than Seropositive Serosorters than HIV-negative/unknown status BMSMW (AOR = 0.29, 95% CI 0.16, 0.51). Findings highlight opportunities for clinicians to promote condom use and risk reduction among BMSMW with differing sexual risk profiles. Increased understanding of sexual positioning practices among BMSMW might help address HIV/STIs among this group.

AB  - PURPOSE: This study explored potentially underreported healthcare contexts, clinical experiences, and motivations for adherence in care among virally suppressed Black sexual minority men (BSMM) living with HIV (LWHIV) in Baltimore, MD. METHODS: Go-alongs with two virally suppressed BSMM LWHIV supplemented 27 in-depth interviews of a larger qualitative study guided by Positive Deviance and Life Course Theory. The go-alongs involved accompanying participants' follow-up HIV care visit to obtain a better account of contextual healthcare factors. Observations focused on (1) clinic location and resources, (2) sources of HIV and sexuality stigma or support in the clinic, and (3) patient-provider interactions. RESULTS: We found that facilitators and barriers to viral suppression for BSMM LWHIV included structural factors (i.e., healthcare setting, facility, and services), quality of patient-provider interactions, and personal motivations to achieve viral suppression. CONCLUSION: Clinic accessibility, co-located clinical services, and rapport with clinicians and healthcare staff could be key contextual conditions that facilitate retention in care among BSMM LWHIV.

AB  - The goals and strategies of Black sexual minority men living with HIV (BSMMLWH) who achieve viral suppression require further investigation. This study explored treatment adherence strategies among BSMMLWH with sustained viral suppression. We conducted 27 in-depth qualitative interviews with BSMMLWH in Baltimore, Maryland, and Los Angeles, California, between December 2018 and May 2019. Interviews included questions guided by Positive Deviance and Life Course theoretical frameworks regarding multilevel factors and explicit strategies for antiretroviral therapy adherence. Themes regarding intentional, age group-specific strategies such as using technology (among younger men) and taking HIV medications with other daily pills (among older men) were identified. Participants also reported symbiotic goals and values that encouraged adherence, such as having a desire to live, strong familial relationships with clinicians, and support networks. Identifying personal goals and having supportive clinical and social relationships could be key to improving treatment adherence and viral suppression among BSMMLWH.

AB  - Estimates show a 50% lifetime human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) risk among Black men who have sex with men (BMSM) in the United States(U.S.). Studying the dynamics of sexual positioning practices among BMSM could provide insights into the disparities observed among U.S. groups of men who have sex with men (MSM). This study explored sexual positioning dynamics among HIV-negative BMSM and how they aligned with a theoretical model of sexual positioning and HIV/sexually transmitted infection (STI) risk among MSM. In-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with 29 HIV-negative BMSM between ages 25 and 35 in Los Angeles. Comments related to sexual behaviors were reviewed for relevance regarding oral or anal sexual positioning practices. Data presented represent the range of themes related to decision making regarding sexual positioning. Personal preference, partner attraction, HIV avoidance, and feeling obligated to practice partner preferences influenced sexual positioning. Drug use also affected decision making and was sometimes preferred in order to practice receptive anal intercourse. These variables build on the conceptual model of sexual positioning practices and sexual risk, and add understanding to the relationship between preferences, practices, and risk management. Future research on risk among HIV-negative BMSM should quantify the relative impact of personal preferences, partner attraction, partner type, compromise, and substance use on sexual positioning practices and risk.

AB  - Increased attention has highlighted the role of age and sexual development on HIV risk among Black MSM (BMSM); limited focus has been given to the relationship of sexual positioning to HIV risk along the life course. This study examined BMSM's life course sexual positioning practices and accompanying HIV/STI risks. Twenty-six Black gay and bisexual men ages 24-61 completed life history interviews in Los Angeles, California, between September and November 2015. Thematic analysis evaluated domains including major life events, substance use, social support, and partner selection. Varying exposure to HIV treatment and prevention options and venues to meet male partners revealed generational differences in sexual risks. Childhood sexual abuse and internalized homonegativity impacted personal development, sexual positioning, and condom negotiation. BMSM also assumed sexual positioning using masculinity stereotypes and body language. Clarifying the sexual development and HIV/STI risk contexts among BMSM could better inform current treatment and prevention needs.

AB  - Sexual positioning practices among men who have sex with men (MSM) have not received a thorough discussion in the MSM and HIV literature, given that risks for acquiring or transmitting HIV and STIs via condomless anal sex vary according to sexual positioning. MSM bear a disproportionate burden of HIV compared to the general population in the United States; surveillance efforts suggest that HIV and STIs are increasing among domestic and international populations of MSM. We conducted a narrative review, using a targeted literature search strategy, as an initial effort to explore processes through which sexual positioning practices may contribute to HIV/STI transmission. Peer-reviewed articles were eligible for inclusion if they contained a measure of sexual positioning identity and/or behavior (i.e., "top", "bottom," etc.) or sexual positioning behavior (receptive anal intercourse or insertive anal intercourse), or assessed the relationship between sexual positioning identity with HIV risk, anal sex practice, masculinity, power, partner type, or HIV status. A total of 23 articles met our inclusion criteria. This review highlights dynamic psychosocial processes likely underlying sexual decision making related to sexual positioning identity and practices among MSM and MSM who have sex with women (MSMW), and ways these contexts may influence HIV/STI risk. Despite limited focus in the extant literature, this review notes the important role the contextual factors (masculinity stereotypes, power, partner type, and HIV status) likely to play in influencing sexual positioning identity and practices. Through this review we offer an initial synthesis of the literature describing sexual positioning identities and practices and conceptual model to provide insight into important areas of study through future research.

However, BSMM perceive others as PrEP candidates instead of themselves and are less likely than other groups to use PrEP if prescribed. Peers and smartphone apps are popular HIV prevention intervention tools typically used independently. However, they could be useful together in a multicomponent strategy to improve perceived HIV risk and PrEP initiation for this group. Information regarding attitudes and preferences toward this multicomponent strategy is limited. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is to obtain attitudes and perspectives regarding the design of a multicomponent intervention that uses a smartphone app and a peer change agent (PCA) to increase perceived HIV risk and PrEP initiation. The intervention will be refined based on thematic findings for a culturally responsive approach. METHODS: Data were obtained guided by life course theory and the health belief model using 12 focus groups and 1 in-depth interview among HIV-negative BSMM from Baltimore, MD, between October 2019 and May 2020 (n=39). Groups were stratified by the following ages: 18 to 24 years, 25 to 34 years, and 35 years and older. Participants were provided details regarding an existing mobile app diary to self-monitor sexual behaviors and a hypothetical PCA with whom to review the app. Facilitators posed questions regarding perceived HIV risk, attitudes toward the app, working with a PCA, and preferences for PCA characteristics and approaches. RESULTS: Most participants identified as homosexual, gay, or same gender-loving (26/38, 68%), were employed (26/38, 69%), single (25/38, 66%), and interested in self-monitoring sexual behaviors (28/38, 68%). However, themes suggested that participants had low perceived HIV risk, that self-monitoring sexual behaviors using a mobile app diary was feasible but could trigger internalized stigma, and that an acceptable PCA should be a possible self for BSMM to aspire to but they still wanted clinicians to "do their job." CONCLUSIONS: HIV-negative BSMM have dissonant attitudes regarding perceived HIV risk and the utility of a mobile app and PCA to increase perceived HIV risk and PrEP initiation. Future research will explore the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary impact of implementing the multicomponent intervention on perceived HIV risk and PrEP initiation among BSMM in a pilot study.

AB  - Background HIV testing, treatment initiation and treatment adherence have been emphasised for Black men who have sex with men (BMSM). However, many BMSM do not get tested, obtain HIV treatment or adhere to treatment. It is essential to highlight barriers to HIV testing, treatment adherence and the ideal components for an intervention: peer mentors, socioeconomic resources and participant incentives. METHODS: Five focus groups (n=24) were conducted among HIV-negative and HIV-positive BMSM aged ≥18 years in Los Angeles, California, USA to explore motivations and barriers to testing and treatment and the components of an ideal, culturally competent HIV testing intervention for BMSM. RESULTS: Barriers to HIV testing included fear and stigma associated with discovering a HIV-positive status and drug use. Motivations for testing included experiencing symptoms, beginning new relationships, perceptions of risk and peer mentors. CONCLUSIONS: Future HIV prevention and treatment efforts should consider these components to improve health outcomes among BMSM.

AB  - A basic Public Health approach to the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) epidemic has been considered by many to be the most appropriate initial strategy against the spread of this infection. Comprehensive Preventive Medicine services were implemented at Naval Hospital Bethesda, which utilized a sexually transmitted disease (STD) model and included: counseling and education; sexual contact interviews and spouse evaluations; Blood Bank Look Back tracking of donated blood; reporting of notifiable diseases; and screening of transfusion recipients, STD cases, and other at-risk populations. This coordinated approach is highly efficient and capable of evaluating the increasing numbers of HIV-positive individuals.

AB  - This paper investigates whether the time period during which retrospective behavioral data are collected affects the results of studies of HIV risk factors. In particular, we address the concern that questionnaires probing behaviors in the recent past may not isolate the risk behaviors involved at the time of actual HIV infection. During 1987 and 1988, 278 street-recruited injecting drug users (IDUs) in New York City were interviewed about their sexual behaviors, medical history, drug-injection behaviors in the prior ten years, and specific needle-use behaviors during 1985-86 and thereafter. Among the 278 subjects, 52% were HIV-seropositive. In univariate analysis, serostatus was significantly related to: a) total drug-injection frequency during 1983-84 and 1985-86; b) mean monthly total drug-injection frequency during 1977 to 1987; c)cocaine injection frequencies during 1983-84 and 1985-86, and during the last thirty days, and d) injecting in shooting galleries and using previously used cookers during 1985-86. Significant predictors of seroprevalence in stepwise logistic regression were total drug and cocaine injection frequencies during; 1983-84, years of injection, residence in the Bronx, not being Hispanic and history of any sexually transmitted disease, The data confirm previous reports on behavioral risk factors for HIV serostatus. Re-analysis using drug;injection frequency data for different time periods indicates that in the context of an ''older'' HIV epidemic like that in New York City, analysis of risk factors may be less sensitive to time periods than had previously been feared, although it may be true that data for behaviors in ''the last thirty days'' cover a sufficiently atypical period as to produce misleading results.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Providing needles to people who inject drugs is a well-proven public health response to the transmission of HIV and other blood borne viruses. Despite over a quarter of a century of research, new concerns about potential unintended negative consequences of needle distribution continue to emerge. Specifically, a claim was recently made that the introduction of pharmacy sales of needles was followed by an increase in overdoses in pharmacy parking lots. If true, this would have serious implications for the design of needle access programs, particularly those involving pharmacy sales of needles. METHODS: We examine spatial relationships between drug-related deaths and pharmacies in Los Angeles County (population 9.8 million) before and after the 2007 enactment of a California law allowing pharmacy sales of needles without a prescription. Seven thousand and forty-nine drugs related deaths occurred in Los Angeles county from 2000 to 2009 inclusive. Four thousand two hundred and seventy-five of these deaths could be geocoded, and were found to be clustered at the census tract level. RESULTS: We used three methods to examine spatial relationships between overdose death locations and pharmacy locations for two years on either side of the enactment of the pharmacy sales law, and found no statistically significant changes. Among the 711 geocodable deaths occurring in the two years following the change in law, no death was found to occur within 50m of a pharmacy which sold needles. CONCLUSION: These results are consistent with prior studies which suggest pharmacy sales of needles improve access to needles without causing increased harms to the surrounding community.

AB  - Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) uptake remains low among Black men who have sex with men (BMSM). PrEPLine, launched in August 2015, based in Chicago, was designed to support PrEP linkage among BMSM. PrEPLine moves clients through the Motivational PrEP Cascade, addresses barriers, and tracks outcomes. Study findings suggest that three variables (i.e., being gay/same gender loving, living more than 15 miles from a clinic location, rescheduling an appointment) demonstrated a significant positive association with initiating PrEP. A subanalysis of BMSM found that two variables (i.e., living on the West Side of Chicago relative to those living on the South Side, and among those living in communities with a higher rate of poverty [more than 30%], relative to those living in communities with a lower rate of poverty [less than 20%]) demonstrated a significant negative association with initiating PrEP.

AB  - This study provides insight into seniors' perceptions of and responses to direct-to-consumer prescription drug advertising (DTCA) usefulness, examines support for DTCA regulation as a type of uncertainty management, and extends and gives empirical voice to previous survey results through methodological triangulation. In-depth interview findings revealed that, for most informants, DTCA usefulness was uncertain and this uncertainty stemmed from 4 sources. The majority had negative responses to DTCA uncertainty and relied on 2 uncertainty-management strategies: information seeking from physicians, and inferences of and support for some government regulation of DTCA. Overall, the findings demonstrate the viability of uncertainty management theory (Brashers, 2001, 2007) for mass-mediated health communication, specifically DTCA. The article concludes with practical implications and research recommendations.

AB  - Religious congregations are important community institutions that could help fight HIV/AIDS; however, barriers exist, particularly in the area of prevention. Formative, participatory research is needed to understand the capacity of congregations to address HIV/AIDS. This article describes a study that used community-based participatory research (CBPR) approaches to learn about congregation-sponsored HIV activities. CBPR strategies were used throughout the study, including proposal development, community expert interviews, Community Advisory Board, congregational telephone survey, congregational case studies, and congregational feedback sessions. Involving community consultants, experts, and advisory board members in all stages of the study helped the researchers to conceptualize congregational involvement in HIV, be more sensitive to potential congregational concerns about the research, achieve high response rates, and interpret and disseminate findings. Providing preliminary case findings to congregational participants in an interactive feedback session improved data quality and relationships with the community. Methods to engage community stakeholders can lay the foundation for future collaborative interventions.

AB  - Comparative case studies were used to explore religious congregations' HIV involvement, including types and extent of activities, interaction with external organizations or individuals, and how activities were initiated and have changed over time. The cases included 14 congregations in Los Angeles County representing diverse faith traditions and races-ethnicities. Activities fell into three broad categories: (1) prevention and education; (2) care and support; and (3) awareness and advocacy. Congregations that engaged early in the epidemic focused on care and support while those that became involved later focused on prevention and education. Most congregations interacted with external organizations or individuals to conduct their HIV activities, but promoting abstinence and teaching about condoms were conducted without external involvement. Opportunities exist for congregations to help address a variety of HIV-related needs. However, activities that are mission-congruent, such as providing pastoral care for people with HIV, raising HIV awareness, and promoting HIV testing, appear easier for congregations to undertake than activities aimed at harm reduction.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study assessed trends in HIV risk behaviors among injection drug users in New York City from 1990 to 1997. METHODS: Injection drug users were recruited continuously from a large drug detoxification treatment program (N = 2588) and a research storefront located in a high-drug-use area (N = 2701). Informed consent was obtained, and a trained interviewer administered a structured interview covering sociodemographics, drug use history, HIV risk behavior, and participation in syringe exchange. RESULTS: Trends were assessed for 5 risk behaviors in the 6-month period before the interview. The 3 injection risk behaviors declined significantly over time at each site (all P < .01). When data were pooled across sites, all 5 risk behaviors declined significantly over time (all P < .01). Participation in syringe exchange programs and in HIV counseling and testing increased greatly from 1990 to 1997. CONCLUSIONS: The continuing risk reduction among injection drug users indicates a "declining phase" in the large HIV epidemic in New York City. HIV prevention programs appear to be making an important contribution to the declining phase.

AB  - New York City experienced the first and largest HIV epidemic among injecting drug users (IDUs). Using data collected from IDUs entering the Beth Israel drug detoxification program, we trace the history of this epidemic from the mid-1970s through the early 2000s. The epidemic can best be described in terms of successive stages: (1) introduction and rapid transmission of HIV in the IDU population; (2) stabilization of HIV prevalence at a high level (over 50%); (3) a decline in incidence and prevalence, following large-scale implementation of syringe exchange programs; and (4) a sexual transmission phase, in which HIV prevalence is approximately equal among injecting and noninjecting heroin and cocaine users, and sexual transmission is more important than injecting-related transmission among IDUs. Given the current spread of HIV among IDUs in many places in the world, New York City provides a very strong example for implementation of large-scale comprehensive syringe exchange programs as early as possible in HIV epidemics among IDUs.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We examined racial/ethnic disparities in HIV infection among injection drug users (IDUs) before and after implementation of large-scale syringe exchange programs in New York City. METHODS: Participants were recruited from IDUs entering the Beth Israel drug detoxification program in New York City. Participants (n = 1203) recruited from 1990 through 1994, prior to large-scale syringe exchange programs (pre-exchange), were compared with 1109 participants who began injecting in 1995 or later and were interviewed in 1995 through 2008 (post-exchange). RESULTS: There were large differences in HIV prevalence among pre-exchange vs post-exchange participants (African Americans, 57% vs 15%; Hispanics, 53% vs 5%; Whites, 27% vs 3%). Pre- and post-exchange relative disparities of HIV prevalence were similar for African Americans vs Whites (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 3.46, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.41, 4.96 and AOR = 4.02, 95% CI = 1.67, 9.69, respectively) and Hispanics vs Whites (AOR = 1.76, 95% CI = 1.49, 2.09 and AOR = 1.49, 95% CI = 1.02, 2.17). Racial/ethnic group differences in risk behavior did not explain differences in HIV prevalence. CONCLUSIONS: New interventions are needed to address continuing disparities in HIV infection among IDUs, but self-reported risk behaviors by themselves may not be adequate outcome measures for evaluating interventions to reduce racial/ethnic disparities in HIV infection.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine whether racial/ethnic disparities persist at the "end of the HIV epidemic" (prevalence of untreated HIV infection < 5%; HIV incidence < 0.5 per 100 person-years) among persons who inject drugs (PWID) in New York City. METHODS: We recruited 2404 PWID entering New York City substance use treatment in 2001 to 2005 and 2011 to 2015. We conducted a structured interview, and testing for HIV and herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2; a biomarker for high sexual risk). We estimated incidence by using newly diagnosed cases of HIV. Disparity analyses compared HIV, untreated HIV, HIV-HSV-2 coinfection, HIV monoinfection, and estimated HIV incidence among Whites, African Americans, and Latinos. RESULTS: By 2011 to 2015, Whites, African Americans, and Latino/as met both criteria of our operational "end-of-the-epidemic" definition. All comparisons that included HIV-HSV-2-coinfected persons had statistically significant higher rates of HIV among racial/ethnic minorities. No comparisons limited to HIV monoinfected persons were significant. CONCLUSIONS: "End-of-the-epidemic" criteria were met among White, African American, and Latino/a PWID in New York City, but elimination of disparities may require a greater focus on PWID with high sexual risk.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the potential utility of hepatitis C virus (HCV) seroprevalence as a biomarker for injection risk, and herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2) as a biomarker for sexual risk among injecting drug users (IDUs). We examined the relationships between HCV and HIV and between HSV-2 and HIV among injecting drug users in New York City relative to the large-scale implementation of syringe exchange in the mid-1990s. METHODS: 397 injecting drug users were recruited from a drug detoxification program in New York from 2005 to 2007. Informed consent was obtained, a questionnaire covering demographics, drug use and HIV risk was administered. Blood samples were tested for antibody to HIV, HCV and HSV-2. RESULTS: Among all subjects, HIV prevalence was 17%, HCV prevalence 72% and HSV-2 prevalence 48%. Among IDUs who began injecting before 1995, HIV was 28%, HCV serostatus was strongly associated with HIV serostatus (AOR=8.96, 95% CI 1.16-69.04) and HSV-2 serostatus was not associated with HIV serostatus (AOR=1.31, 95% CI 0.64-2.67). Among subjects who began injecting in 1995 or later, HIV was 6%, HCV was not associated with HIV (AOR=1.04, 95% CI 0.27-4.08) and HSV-2 serostatus was strongly related to HIV serostatus (AOR=10.71, 95% CI 1.18-97.57). CONCLUSIONS: HCV and HSV-2 HCV and HSV-2 may provide important new tools for monitoring evolving HIV epidemics among IDUs. Reconsideration of the current CDC hierarchical transmission risk classification system may also be warranted.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: As no single HIV prevention program has eliminated HIV transmission, there is growing interest in the effectiveness of "combined" prevention programming. To compare HIV infection among persons injecting in the initial programs environment (IPE) in New York City (self-initiated risk reduction, methadone, education/outreach, and HIV testing) to HIV infection among persons injecting in a combined programs environment (CPE) (above programs plus large-scale syringe exchange). To identify potential behavioral mechanisms through which combined programs are effective. METHODS: Subjects were recruited from the Beth Israel drug detoxification program. A risk behavior questionnaire was administered and HIV testing conducted. Subjects who injected only between 1984 and 1994 (IPE) were compared to subjects who injected only between 1995 and 2008 (CPE). RESULTS: 261 IPE subjects and 1153 CPE subjects were recruited. HIV infection was significantly lower among the CPE subjects compared to IPE subjects: prevalence 6% versus 21%, estimated incidence 0.3/100 person-years versus 4/100 person-years (both p<0.001). The percentage of subjects at risk of acquiring HIV through receptive syringe sharing was similar across CPE and IPE subjects (30% versus 33%). The percentage of subjects at risk of transmitting HIV through injection-related behaviors (who were both HIV seropositive and reported passing on used needles/syringes), was much lower among the CPE subjects than among the IPE subjects (1% versus 10%, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Combined prevention programs can greatly reduce HIV transmission. Reducing distributive sharing by HIV seropositive injecting drug users (IDUs) may be a critical component in reducing HIV transmission in high seroprevalence settings.

METHODS: Subjects were recruited from patients entering the Beth Israel drug detoxification program. Informed consent was obtained, a structured questionnaire including demographics, drug use history, and sexual risk behavior was administered, and a blood sample was collected for HIV and HSV-2 antibody testing. RESULTS: A total of 1418 subjects who had never (lifetime) injected drugs (NIDUs) were recruited between July 2005 through June 2009. Subjects were primarily male (76%), and black (67%) or Hispanic (25%), reported recent crack cocaine use (74%), and had a mean age of 42 years. Eleven percent of males reported male-with-male sexual (MSM) behavior. The prevalence of both viruses was high: for HSV-2, 61% among the total sample, 50% among non-MSM males, 85% among females, and 72% among MSM; for HIV, 16% among the total sample, 12% among non-MSM males, 20% among females, and 46% among MSM. HSV-2 was associated with HIV (OR = 3.2, 95% CI: 2.3-4.5; PR = 2.7, 95% CI: 2.0-3.7). Analyses by gender and age groups indicated different patterns in mono- and coinfection for the 2 viruses. DISCUSSION: HSV-2 and HIV rates among these NIDUs are comparable with rates in sub-Saharan Africa. Additional prevention programs, tailored to gender and age groups, are urgently needed. New platforms for providing services to NIDUs are also needed.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess trends in injecting and non-injecting drug use after implementation of large-scale syringe exchange in New York City. The belief that implementation of syringe exchange will lead to increased drug injecting has been a persistent argument against syringe exchange. METHODS: Administrative data on route of administration for primary drug of abuse among patients entering the Beth Israel methadone maintenance program from 1995 to 2007. Approximately 2000 patients enter the program each year. RESULTS: During and after the period of large-scale implementation of syringe exchange, the numbers of methadone program entrants reporting injecting drug use decreased while the numbers of entrants reporting intranasal drug use increased (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: While assessing the possible effects of syringe exchange on trends in injecting drug use is inherently difficult, these may be the strongest data collected to date showing a lack of increase in drug injecting following implementation of syringe exchange.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare HIV prevalence among injecting and non-injecting heroin and cocaine users in New York City. As HIV is efficiently transmitted through the sharing of drug-injecting equipment, HIV infection has historically been higher among injecting drug users. DESIGN: Two separate cross-sectional surveys, both with HIV counseling and testing and drug use and HIV risk behavior questionnaires. METHODS: Injecting and non-injecting heroin and cocaine users recruited at detoxification and methadone maintenance treatment from 2001-2004 (n = 2121) and recruited through respondent-driven sampling from a research storefront in 2004 (n = 448). RESULTS: In both studies, HIV prevalence was nearly identical among current injectors (injected in the last 6 months) and heroin and cocaine users who had never injected: 13% [95% confidence interval (CI), 12-15%] among current injectors and 12% (95% CI, 9-16%) among never-injectors in the drug treatment program study, and 15% (95% CI, 11-19%) among current injectors and 17% (95% CI, 12-21%) among never injectors in the respondent driven sampling storefront study. The 95% CIs overlapped in all gender and race/ethnicity subgroup comparisons of HIV prevalence in both studies. CONCLUSIONS: The very large HIV epidemic among drug users in New York City appears to be entering a new phase, in which sexual transmission is of increasing importance. Additional prevention programs are needed to address this transition.

AB  - AIMS: To characterize heroin and cocaine users in New York City who have changed from injection to non-injection drug administration and to identify factors associated with long-term non-injection use. DESIGN: Two cross-sectional studies of heroin and cocaine users in New York City. SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: New admissions were recruited at drug abuse treatment programs (2000-04) and respondent-driven sampling was used to recruit drug users from the community (2004). Both injecting and non-injecting drug users participated in each study. 'Former injectors' were defined operationally as people who had used heroin and/or cocaine in the 6 months prior to the interview and who had injected illicit drugs in the past, but whose most recent injection was more than 6 months before the study interview. 'Current' injectors were defined as people who had injected heroin and/or cocaine in the 6 months prior to the interview. MEASUREMENTS: A structured interview on drug use history was administered, and a serum sample was collected and tested for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). FINDINGS: A total of 104 former injectors was recruited for the drug abuse treatment program study, and 229 current injectors were recruited for the community recruitment study; 160 former injectors and 1731 current injectors were recruited from the drug abuse treatment study. Compared with the current injectors, former injectors were older and more likely to be African American. The former injectors reported long intervals since their most recent injection, a mean of 8 years in the drug abuse treatment program study and a mean of 12 years in the community recruitment study. The most common reasons for stopping injection drug use included concerns about health, social stigmatization and self-image, and preference for intranasal use as a route of drug administration. The results were highly consistent across the two studies. CONCLUSIONS: The transition from injection to non-injection use appears to be relatively stable behavior change for many former injectors, who report a decade or more without injecting. Developing a greater understanding of the transition from injection to stable non-injection drug use may provide insights into the natural histories of drug use and addiction.

AB  - Illicit drug injection is a major component of the AIDS epidemic in the United States, Europe and some developing countries. Prevention of illicit drug injection would not only reduce HIV transmission but would also reduce the other health, psychological and social problems associated with illicit drug injection. One hundred and four subjects who were using heroin intranasally ('sniffing') were recruited for a study of the transition to drug injection. Eligibility criteria included sniffing as the most frequent route of administration and no more than 60 injections in the past 2 years. All subjects received thorough basic information about AIDS, including HIV antibody test counseling. Subjects were then randomly assigned to a four-session social learning based AIDS/drug injection prevention program or a control condition. Eighty-three subjects were successfully followed at a mean time of 8.9 months. Twenty (24%) of the followed subjects reported injecting illicit drugs during the follow-up period. Drug injection during follow-up was associated with being in the control group, intensity of non-injected drug use, prior injection, and having close personal relationships with current intravenous (IV) drug users.

AB  - Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seroconversion was studied in a group of 173 injection drug users in Bangkok, Thailand, who had been previously tested for HIV and were interviewed and retested in the fall of 1989. Ten percent of the group had seroconverted. Two factors protected against HIV seroconversion: having stopped sharing injection equipment in response to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and having a regular sexual partner. The association between self-reported deliberate risk reduction and reduced HIV seroconversion among persons continuing to inject illicit drugs indicates that injection drug users can change their behavior in response to AIDS and will accurately report on the behavior change, and that the changes can protect against HIV infection.

AB  - Cohort studies of young (aged 18-30 years) injecting drug users recruited in 1997-1999 in the Harlem and Lower East Side areas of New York City, New York, were used to assess the incidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV). The authors found that HIV incidence was low at both sites: 0.8/100 person-years at the Harlem site and 0/100 person-years at the Lower East Side site. In contrast, HBV incidence was moderate (12.2/100 person-years) at the Harlem site and high (30.7/100 person-years) at the Lower East Side site. Similarly, HCV incidence was moderate (9.3/100 person-years) at the Harlem site and high (34.0/100 person-years) at the Lower East Side site. Results show that high rates of HBV and HCV transmission do not imply high rates of HIV transmission, even within an area of high HIV seroprevalence.

AB  - Research on the epidemiology of HIV infection among IV drug users is still at a relatively early stage. Multilocation studies that would permit better geographic comparisons are greatly needed. Multi-method studies within single geographic areas are also needed to assess possible biases with respect to sample recruitment and data collection procedures. The continuation of the epidemic provides a changing historical context that complicates any comparisons. Despite these problems, there are some consistencies that can be seen across studies. Studies of HIV seroprevalence among IV drug users show wide variation among cities in the United States and Europe. The time that the virus was introduced into the IV drug using group within the city is one factor in explaining these differences; other cross-city factors have yet to be identified. Once HIV has been introduced into the IV drug use group within a particular geographic area, there is the possibility of rapid spread up to seroprevalence levels of 50% or greater. Thus, a currently low seroprevalence rate should not be seen as a stable situation. Frequency of injection and sharing of equipment with multiple other drug users (particularly at shooting galleries) have been frequently associated with HIV exposure. Being female, ethnicity (in the USA) and engaging in prostitution also may be associated with increased risk for HIV exposure, suggesting that prevention programs should include special consideration of sex and ethnic differences. Studies of AIDS risk reduction show that substantial proportions of IV drug users are changing their behavior to avoid exposure to HIV. This risk reduction is probably more advanced in New York, with its high seroprevalence and incidence of cases, but is also occurring in cities with lower seroprevalence and limited numbers of cases. The primary forms of risk reduction are increasing the use of sterile equipment, reducing the number of needle sharing partners, and reducing the frequency of injection. These behavior changes are very similar to the frequently identified behavioral risk factors associated with HIV exposure, suggesting that they should be effective in at least slowing the spread of HIV among IV drug users. No linkage of risk reduction to decreases in seroconversion has yet been shown, however, and greater risk reduction is clearly required. A variety of prevention strategies will probably be needed to reduce the spread of HIV among IV drug users. Prevention of initiation into drug injection is an undeniable long-term goal for the control of HIV infection, but there is very little research being conducted in this area.
Published and unpublished reports on HIV seroprevalence and risk reduction among IV drug users (IVDU) are reviewed as of 1986. The seroprevalence of HIV among IVDUs varies widely by location, often with a north-south gradient. The strongest indicator of prevalence is the date of introduction of HIV, with rates as high as 50% appearing within 2 years. The behavioral risk factors are sharing injection equipment partners, using shooting galleries, being a female prostitute or a member of a minority ethnic group. There are no data yet on whether removing barriers to sterile syringes and needles or needle exchange programs is effective in cutting the spread of HIV. There are some hints that IVDUs are capable of altering risky behavior. Surveys of 2 groups of methadone maintenance client suggest increased knowledge of HIV risks and increased use of clean needles. It is reported that the black market for needles in New York City has shown increased sales, that sales of syringes with extra needles are popular, that heroin sellers are including sterile syringes with bags, and even that re-packaged used unsterile needles are enjoying a brisk profit on the street. There are suggestions that IVDUs in Amsterdam and San Francisco are altering their high risk behaviors. Data from Amsterdam shows that IVDUs have not increased their frequency of injection nor reduced their demand for drug treatment as a result of the needle exchange program. Possible prevention strategies are education of people before they initiate IV drug use; provision of ample drug treatment as a cost effective means of reducing the expense of treating AIDS patients; and providing sterile needles or teaching IVDUs how to clean syringes and needles. Probably a mixed strategy will be to reduce the risk of HIV or IVDUs.

AB  - There is now evidence from a wide variety of geographic areas that many intravenous drug users will change their behavior in order to reduce their risk of developing AIDS. There is even evidence from some areas that the behavior change has led to relative stabilization of seroprevalence rates, although longer-term studies will be needed to establish this definitively. AIDS behavior change in the area of sexual risk reduction appears to be much more difficult than change of drug injection behavior. Conceptual models of AIDS-related behavior change are needed, particularly models that can incorporate the injection of different drugs and variation in social and psychological characteristics among drug injectors. There is increasing evidence for a wider spectrum of HIV-related morbidity and mortality among intravenous drug users than is captured by the current surveillance definition for AIDS, again emphasizing the need for effective prevention programs.
Topics concerning intravenous drug use and AIDS are reviewed. Topics include seroprevalence of HIV among users worldwide, evidence that iv drug users will alter behavior to avoid AIDS, results of safer injections programs, no evidence for reduction in high-risk behavior regarding sexual transmission of AIDS by users, diversity in HIV prevalence among users, and clinical aspects of their disease. Seroprevalence of HIV among drug users has remained at about 30% in the U.S. and parts of Europe, while lower in Asia and South America. There is now evidence from several places in Europe and the U.S. that many iv drug users will change drug injecting behavior to avoid AIDS. A conceptual model of new social norms needed to change behavior involves 3 stages: knowing the dangers of AIDS, having the means to change behavior (treatment or clean syringes), and a mechanism to reinforce the new behavior (perceived efficacy or social approval). There is no evidence that safer injection programs either keep users from going to treatment or increase numbers of users. In contrast, there is no evidence for improved sexual risk-taking behaviors among users, a fact which argues for stronger efforts to prevent already infected users from spreading HIV. The public, policy-markers, and researchers are unaware that seroprevalence of HIV varies with the type of drug injected (cocaine; heroin; amphetamine), and with socioeconomic status of the user (ethnic minority; majority). The clinical presentation, infection rate, persistence of infection, and mortality rate among iv drug users differs from that of the general AIDS population. Endocarditis, tuberculosis and bacterial pneumonias are 3 of the common findings in drug users. Even "non-AIDS" deaths apparently due to immunosuppression are reported in drug users. There may be undiscovered co-factors in HIV infection in this population.

AB  - The paper identifies and reviews some critical issues in the field of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission among intravenous drug users. First, it discusses political denial and compartmentalization of the problem, giving an example from the United States that illustrates the lack of a coherent national strategy. It then reviews the role that stereotypes play in policy-making and points out that behaviour change can be considerable, giving details of successful safer injection programmes. The conditions that foster injection as a mode of ingesting drugs are reviewed, as in the role of drug trans-shipment patterns, particularly as a possible conduit of HIV. Finally, the role of prisons as places for the spread of HIV, and therefore for its prevention, is discussed.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) was formally identified among injecting drug users (IDUs) in 1981, and research on preventing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection among drug injectors began shortly thereafter. At the time this research was begun, there was a general assumption that drug user (who were called drug abusers at that time) were too self-destructive and their behavior too chaotic for them to change their behavior to avoid infection with HIV. This chapter reviews the history of research on implementation of programs for prevention of HIV infection among IDUs. METHODS: Reviews of both research and program implementation research were conducted. Consultative discussions of issues and findings were conducted with researcher in the United States and other countries. RESULTS: An extremely large amount of useful information has accumulated during the pat 15 years. We now know that the great majority of IDUs will change their injecting behavior in response to the threat of AIDS and that these behavior changes are effective in reducing HIV transmission among drug injectors. Additional insight is needed regarding the apparent insufficiency of some prevention programs to control HIV, the transmission dynamics of rapid HIV spread, and the persistence of moderate to high incidence of HIV infection in high seroprevalence populations. Despite the current research knowledge base, implementation of effective prevention programs in may countries is nonexistent to incomplete. CONCLUSIONS: The most important barrier to reducing HIV transmission among drug injectors is not a lack of knowledge but the failure to implement effective prevention programs in may parts of the world.

AB  - Studies were reviewed with respect to three different target groups for preventing AIDS among intravenous (IV) drug users by (a) providing drug abuse treatment for those who want to stop injecting drugs, (b) providing "safer" injection for those who are likely to continue injecting, and (c) preventing drug injection among those who are at high risk for beginning to inject. The studies reviewed were limited to those that include "hard" data: validated self-reports, seroprevalence outcomes, or self-reports of behavior that is the opposed to any of the demand characteristics generated by the research setting. For two groups of current IV drug users--those entering drug treatment and those continuing to inject--these hard data studies show rapidly induced AIDS risk reduction but suggest a need for large-scale change maintained over long time periods. In terms of preventing initial injection, alternative forms of intense drug use have emerged but have not supplanted drug injection, and basic knowledge of AIDS does not appear to deter initial drug injection.

AB  - HIV/AIDS and iv drug use (IVDU) are of significant multinational scope and growing. Supporting increased IVDU in many countries are countries' geographical proximity to illicit drug trafficking distribution routes, law enforcement efforts which increase the demand for more efficient drug distribution and consumption, and countries' infrastructural and social modernization. Given the failures of intensified law enforcement efforts to thwart the use and proliferation of illegal drugs, countries with substantial IVDU should look away from preventing use to preventing HIV transmission within drug user populations. With HIV seroprevalence rates rapidly reaching 40-50% in some developing country IVDU groups, a variety of prevention programs is warranted. Such programs should be supported and implemented while prevention remains feasible. This paper examines the variation in HIV seroprevalence among IVD users, rapid HIV spread among users, HIV among IVDUs in Bangkok, emerging issues in HIV transmission among IVDUs, non-AIDS manifestations of HIV infection among IVDUs, prevention programs and effectiveness, and harm reduction.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To identify factors associated with effective AIDS behavior change among injecting drug users (IDU) in different national settings. DESIGN: Cross-sectional surveys of IDU, with determination of HIV status. Trends in city HIV seroprevalence among IDU also used to validate effectiveness of behavior change. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Subjects recruited from drug-use treatment programs and outreach efforts in Bangkok, Thailand (n = 601), Glasgow, Scotland (n = 919), New York City, USA (n = 2539), and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (n = 466). RESULTS: Evidence for the effectiveness of self-reported risk reduction was available for all cities. Univariate followed by multiple logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with self-reported AIDS behavior change. Separate analyses were conducted for each city. Talking about AIDS with drug-using friends was significantly associated with behavior change in all four cities. Talking with sex partners about AIDS, educational level, knowing that someone can be HIV-infected and still look healthy, and having been tested previously for HIV were each significantly associated with behavior change in three of the four cities. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the substantial differences in these national settings, there were common factors associated with effective risk reduction. In particular, risk reduction appears to occur through social processes rather than through individual attitude change. HIV prevention programs need to explicitly incorporate social processes into their work.

AB  - Intravenous drug users are the second largest risk group for the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and a bridge to two other groups: children and heterosexual partners. In the absence of effective treatment or vaccines, control of the epidemic among drug users will rely on efforts to reduce needle sharing. However, the traditional image of intravenous drug users leads one to expect little or no risk reduction. We review characteristics of AIDS as a disease that impede efforts at risk reduction among drug users and report on current risk reduction among intravenous drug users in New York City. There has been a sustained increase in the demand for new, unused needles, as shown in the emergence of "resealed" needles and in interviews with persons selling needles in illicit drug-purchasing areas.

AB  - A cohort of 334 intravenous (IV) drug users from New York City drug treatment programs were followed over a mean 9-month period. Among the 165 who were seropositive at enlistment, four developed clinical AIDS, for an annual rate of 3%. Elevated IgA was a significant predictor of developing AIDS. Among 72 subjects who were initially seronegative and who were re-interviewed, four were seropositive at follow-up, for a seroconversion rate of 7% per year among seronegatives. Among seropositive subjects who did not develop AIDS or fatal AIDS related complex (ARC), continued drug injection was associated with rate of T4 cell loss, and there was a non-significant trend for males to lose T4 cells more rapidly than females. While it was not possible to distinguish the mechanism underlying the relationship between continued drug injection and T4 cell loss, seropositive IV drug users should be warned that continued injection may lead to increased HIV-related immunosuppression as well as, if injection equipment is shared, risking viral transmission to others.

AB  - Recent cases of "AIDS-like" CD4 lymphocytopenia in the absence of HIV infection have generated considerable scientific and public interest. We studied CD4 cell counts and percentages from 1984 to 1992 among 1,246 HIV-seronegative injecting drug users in New York City, a population at very high risk for exposure to bloodborne pathogens. Severe CD4 lymphocytopenia was rare, and there was no evidence of an increase over time. Of 229 subjects with longitudinal data, only four met the surveillance definition for "idiopathic CD4 lymphocytopenia" (ICL). CD4 cell counts of < 500 cells/microliters were, however, associated with subsequent HIV seroconversion (12.7/100 person-years at risk, relative risk (RR) = 4.53, 95% exact binomial confidence interval (CI) 1.7-10.7, p = 0.002).

AB  - Intravenous drug users are the second largest group to develop the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and they are the primary source for heterosexual and perinatal transmission in the United States and Europe. Understanding long-term trends in the spread of human immunodeficiency virus among intravenous drug users is critical to controlling the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome epidemic. Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome surveillance data and seroprevalence studies of drug treatment program entrants are used to trace seroprevalence trends among intravenous drug users in the borough of Manhattan. The virus entered this drug-using group during the mid-1970s and spread rapidly in 1979 through 1983. From 1984 through 1987, the seroprevalence rate stabilized between 55% and 60%--well below hepatitis B seroprevalence rates. This relatively constant rate is attributed to new infections, new seronegative persons beginning drug injection, seropositive persons leaving drug injection, and increasing conscious risk reduction.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine HIV risk behavior and HIV infection among new initiates into illicit drug injection in New York City. DESIGN AND METHODS: Cross-sectional surveys of injecting drug users (IDUs) recruited from a large detoxification treatment program (n=2489) and a street store-front research site (n=2630) in New York City from 1990 through 1996. Interviews covering demographics, drug use history, and HIV risk behavior were administered; serum samples were collected for HIV testing. Subjects were categorized into two groups of newer injectors: very recent initiates (just began injecting through 3 years) and recent initiates (injecting 4-6 years); and long-term injectors (injecting > or = 7 years). RESULTS: 954 of 5119 (19%) of the study subjects were newer injectors, essentially all of whom had begun injecting after knowledge about AIDS was widespread among IDUs in the city. New injectors were more likely to be female and white than long-term injectors, and new injectors were more likely to have begun injecting at an older age (median age at first injection for very recent initiates, 27 years; median age at first injection for recent initiates, 25 years; compared with median age at first injection for long-term injectors, 17 years). The newer injectors generally matched the long-term injectors in frequencies of HIV risk behavior; no significant differences were found among these groups on four measures of injection risk behavior. HIV infection was substantial among the newer injectors: HIV prevalence was 11% among the very recent initiates and 18% among the recent initiates. Among the new injectors, African Americans, Hispanics, females, and men who engaged in male-male sex were more likely to be infected. CONCLUSIONS: The new injectors appear to have adopted the reduced risk injection practices of long-term injectors in the city. HIV infection among new injectors, however, must still be considered a considerable public health problem in New York City.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine trends in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) risk behavior and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seroprevalence among injecting drug users (IDUs) in New York City from 1984 through 1992. DESIGN AND SETTING: Comparisons were made between two surveys of IDUs at the same hospital-based New York City drug abuse detoxification program: 141 IDUs in 1984 and 974 IDUs in 1990 through 1992. National Death Registry, New York City Health Department, and drug treatment program records were also used. PARTICIPANTS: Persons attending detoxification program randomly selected for participation. Eligibility was based on injection within previous 2 months; 99% acceptance rates were obtained. Participants in the 1984 and 1990 through 1992 surveys were 66% and 79% men, 21% and 19% white, 33% and 34% African American, and 45% and 46% Latin American, respectively. INTERVENTIONS: Community-based AIDS prevention programs, including underground syringe exchanges. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome risk behaviors; HIV serostatus; CD4+ cell counts; death rates among 1984 subjects; and injection and intranasal routes of drug administration. RESULTS: The HIV seroprevalence remained stable at slightly more than 50%. Mean CD4+ cell counts declined from 0.716 x 10(9)/L (716/microL) to 0.575 x 10(9)/L (P < .009). Annual death rate among 1984 subjects was 3%, with a significantly higher rate among HIV-seropositive subjects (relative risk, 2.57; 95% exact binomial confidence interval, 1.12 to 6.61). Large-scale declines were observed in AIDS risk behaviors, eg, use of potentially contaminated syringes declined from 51% to 7% of injections (P < .001). Recent additional risk reduction was associated with use of the underground syringe exchanges. Intranasal heroin use was the primary route of drug administration for 46% of heroin admissions to New York City drug treatment programs. CONCLUSIONS: The HIV seroprevalence has remained stable among this population of New York City IDUs for almost a decade. Continuation of current trends should lead to further reduction in HIV transmission, although reversal of the trend to intranasal use could lead to substantially increased transmission.

AB  - As the second largest group of persons to have been infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and the most likely to transmit HIV to heterosexual partners in the United States and Europe, iv drug users will play an increasingly important role in the future of the AIDS epidemic. This paper reviews five emerging critical issues regarding HIV infection among iv drug users. In epidemiology, rates of drug injection and anonymous sharing of injection equipment appear related to rapid spread of HIV among iv drug users, while heterosexual transmission from iv drug users appears to have been occurring at a relatively slow but constant rate. Data exist that support a gender-related cofactor and a continuing drug injection cofactor, but mechanisms for these potential cofactors have not been determined. Besides frank AIDS, HIV infection also appears to lead to epidemic-level increases in a variety of fatal infections among iv drug users. Several studies of prevention show active risk reduction among iv drug users, but new methods are urgently needed to increase amount of risk reduction.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the relationship between self-reported acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) behavioral change and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) serostatus among injection drug users. METHODS: The study sample involved 4419 injection drug users recruited from drug abuse treatment and nontreatment settings in 11 cities in North America, South America, Europe, Asia, and Australia. The World Health Organization multisite risk behavior questionnaire was used, and either blood or saliva samples for HIV testing were obtained. Subjects were asked, "Since you first heard about AIDS, have you done anything to avoid getting AIDS?" RESULTS: The protective odds ratio for behavioral change against being infected with HIV was 0.50 (95% confidence interval = 0.42, 0.59). While there was important variation across sites, the relationship remained consistent across both demographic and drug use history subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: Injection drug users are capable of modifying their HIV risk behaviors and reporting accurately on behavioral changes. These behavioral changes are associated with their avoidance of HIV infection.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) seroprevalence and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seroprevalence among noninjecting heroin and cocaine users in New York City. METHODS: Four hundred sixty-two noninjecting cocaine and heroin users were recruited from a drug detoxification program in New York City. Smoking crack cocaine, intranasal use of heroin, and intranasal use of cocaine were the most common types of drug use. A structured interview was administered and a serum sample was collected for HIV and HSV testing. RESULTS: HIV prevalence was 19% (95% CI 15%-22%) and HSV-2 seroprevalence was 60% (95% CI 55%-64%). The adjusted risk ratio for the association between HSV-2 and HIV was 1.9 (95% CI 1.21%-2.98%). The relationship between HSV-2 and HIV was particularly strong among females, among whom 86% were HSV-2 seropositive, 23% were HIV seropositive, and all HIV seropositives were also HSV-2 seropositive. CONCLUSIONS: HSV-2 appears to be an important factor in sexual transmission of HIV among noninjecting cocaine and heroin users in New York City, especially among females. The estimated population attributable risk for HIV infection attributable to HSV-2 infection in this sample was 38%. Programs to manage HSV-2 infection should be developed as part of comprehensive HIV prevention for noninjecting drug users.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe prevention activities and risk behavior in cities where human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was introduced into the local population of injecting drug users (IDUs), but where seroprevalence has nevertheless remained low (< 5%) during at least 5 years. DESIGN AND SETTING: A literature search identified five such cities: Glasgow, Scotland; Lund, Sweden; Sydney, New South Wales, Australia; Tacoma, Wash; and Toronto, Ontario. Case histories were prepared for each city, including data on prevention activities and current levels of risk behavior among IDUs. PARTICIPANTS: Injecting drug users recruited from both drug treatment and non-treatment settings in each city. INTERVENTIONS: A variety of HIV prevention activities for IDUs had been implemented in each of the five cities. RESULTS: There were three common prevention components present in all five cities: (1) implementation of prevention activities when HIV seroprevalence was still low, (2) provision of sterile injection equipment, and (3) community outreach to IDUs. Moderate levels of risk behavior continued with one third or more of the IDUs reporting recent unsafe injections. CONCLUSIONS: In low-seroprevalence areas, it appears possible to severely limit transmission of HIV among populations of IDUs, despite continuing risk behavior among a substantial proportion of the population. Pending further studies, the common prevention components (beginning early, community outreach, and access to sterile injection equipment) should be implemented wherever populations of IDUs are at risk for rapid spread of HIV.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We assessed recent (1992-1997) HIV incidence in the large HIV epidemic among injection drug users in New York City. METHODS: Data were compiled from 10 separate studies (N = 4979), including 6 cohort studies, 2 "repeat service user" studies, and 2 analyses of voluntary HIV testing and counseling services within drug treatment programs. RESULTS: In the 10 studies, 52 seroconversions were found in 6344 person-years at risk. The observed incidence rates among the 10 studies were all within a narrow range, from 0 per 100 person-years at risk to 2.96 per 100 person-years at risk. In 9 of the 10 studies, the observed incidence rate was less than 2 per 100 person-years at risk. The weighted average incidence rate was 0.7 per 100 person-years at risk. CONCLUSIONS: The recent incidence rate in New York City is quite low for a high-seroprevalence population of injection drug users. The very large HIV epidemic among injection drug users in New York City appears to have entered a "declining phase," characterized by low incidence and declining prevalence. The data suggest that very large high-seroprevalence HIV epidemics may be "reversed."

AB  - BACKGROUND: There have been no studies showing that participation in programmes which provide legal access to drug-injection equipment leads to individual-level protection against incident HIV infection. We have compared HIV incidence among injecting drug users participating in syringe-exchange programmes in New York City with that among non-participants. METHODS: We used meta-analytic techniques to combine HIV incidence data from injecting drug users in three studies: the Syringe Exchange Evaluation (n = 280), in which multiple interviews and saliva samples were collected from participants at exchange sites; the Vaccine Preparedness initiative cohort (n = 133 continuing exchanges and 188 non-exchangers, in which participants were interviewed and tested for HIV every 3 months; and very-high-seroprevalence cities in the National AIDS Demonstration Research (NADR) programme (n = 1029), in which street-recruited individuals were interviewed and tested for HIV every 6 months. In practice, participants in the NADR study had not used syringe exchanges. FINDINGS: HIV incidence among continuing exchange-users in the Syringe Exchange Evaluation was 1.58 per 100 person-years at risk (95% CI 0.54, 4.65) and among continuing exchange-users in the Vaccine Preparedness Initiative it was 1.38 per 100 person-years at risk (0.23, 4.57). Incidence among non-users of the exchange in the Vaccine Preparedness Initiative was 5.26 per 100 person-years at risk (2.41, 11.49), and in the NADR cities, 6.23 per 100 person-years at risk (4.4, 8.6). In a pooled-data, multivariate proportional-hazards analysis, not using the exchanges was associated with a hazard ratio of 3.35 (95% CI 1.29, 8.65) for incident HIV infection compared with using the exchanges. INTERPRETATION: We observed an individual-level protective effect against HIV infection associated with participation in a syringe-exchange programme. Sterile injection equipment should be legally provided to reduce the risk of HIV infection in persons who inject illicit drugs.

AB  - One third of all cases of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in the United States are associated with the injection of illicit drugs. There is mounting evidence for the effectiveness of syringe exchange programs in reducing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) risk behavior and HIV transmission among injection drug users. Expansion of syringe exchange would require increased public funding and undoubtedly would include government regulation of syringe exchanges. An analogy is drawn with the present system of regulation of methadone maintenance treatment programs and possible regulation of syringe exchange programs. Specific recommendations are offered to reduce the likelihood of repeating the regulatory problems of methadone maintenance treatment in future regulation of syringe exchange programs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We aimed to assess audio-computer-assisted self-interviewing (audio-CASI) as a method of reducing under-reporting of HIV risk behaviour among injecting drug users. METHODS: Injecting drug users were interviewed at syringe-exchange programmes in four US cities. Potential respondents were randomly selected from participants in the syringe exchanges, with weekly alternate assignment to either traditional face-to-face interviews or audio-CASI. The questionnaire included items on sociodemographic characteristics, drug use, and HIV risk behaviours for 30 days preceding the interview. We calculated odds ratios for the difference in reporting of HIV risk behaviours between interview methods. FINDINGS: 757 respondents were interviewed face-to-face, and 724 were interviewed by audio-CASI. More respondents reported HIV risk behaviours and other sensitive behaviours in audio-CASI than in face-to-face interviews (odds ratios for reporting of rented or bought used injection equipment in audio-CASI vs face-to-face interview 2.1 [95% CI 1.4-3.3] p=0.001; for injection with borrowed used injection equipment 1.5 [1.1-2.2] p=0.02; for renting or selling used equipment 2.3 [1.3-4.0] p=0.003). INTERPRETATION: Although validation of these self-reported behaviours was not possible, we propose that audio-CASI enables substantially more complete reporting of HIV risk behaviour. More complete reporting might increase understanding of the dynamics of HIV transmission and make the assessment of HIV-prevention efforts easier.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess recent developments in the HIV epidemic in injecting drug users (IDUs) in New York City. With >50,000 cases of AIDS in IDUs, New York has experienced the largest HIV/AIDS epidemic in IDUs of any city in the world. METHODS: Serial cross-sectional surveys conducted continuously from 1990 to 2001 of IDUs entering the Beth Israel Medical Center (BIMC) drug detoxification program in New York City. HIV serostatus, use of prevention services, and risk behaviors were measured. Individuals were permitted to participate multiple times in the surveys but not more than once in any year. RESULTS: Two thousand eight hundred eighty-seven individuals contributed 3100 observations from 1990 to 2001. There was a substantial and consistent decline in the prevalence of HIV infection among IDUs entering the BIMC detoxification program, from 54% (165/304) in 1991 to 13% (39/303) in 2001 (P < 0.0001). The decline was highly linear, with r2 = 0.92 and a slope of -3.7% in seroprevalence per year. The decline occurred for both males and females, both short and long-term IDUs, and the three largest racial/ethnic subgroups (all P < 0.001 by Cochran-Armitage testing). Use of HIV prevention services increased substantially, particularly syringe exchange and voluntary HIV counseling and testing. General reductions in injection risk behaviors occurred, but substantial numbers of IDUs continued to engage in both receptive and distributive syringe sharing. Two conditional types of risk reduction not currently recommended by health authorities were reported: "informed altruism," in which persons who knew that they were HIV seropositive reduced transmission behavior, and "partner restriction," in which persons who shared needles and syringes primarily confined this sharing within small social networks. CONCLUSIONS: HIV infection continues to decline in this population of IDUs in New York City, suggesting the possibility of bringing very high prevalence epidemics under control. Risk elimination may not be required; rather, multiple forms of risk reduction may be effective in reducing HIV transmission within a local population of IDUs.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We sought to estimate HIV incidence among injection drug users (IDUs) in New York City from 1990 to 2002 to assess the impact of an expansion of syringe exchange services. Syringe exchange increased greatly during this period, from 250,000 to 3,000,000 syringes exchanged annually. METHODS: Serum samples were obtained from serial cross-sectional surveys of 3,651 IDUs. HIV-positive samples were tested with the Serologic Test Algorithm for Recent HIV Seroconversion (STARHS) assay to identify recent HIV infections and to estimate HIV incidence. Consistency with other incidence studies was used to assess strengths and limitations of STARHS. RESULTS: HIV incidence declined from 3.55/100 person-years at risk (PYAR) from 1990-1992, to 2.63/100 PYAR from 1993-1995, to 1.05/100 PYAR from 1996-1998, and to 0.77/100 PYAR from 1999-2002 (P<.001). There was a very strong negative linear relationship (r= -.99, P<.005) between the annual numbers of syringes exchanged and estimated HIV incidence. These results were highly consistent with a large number of shorter incidence studies among IDUs conducted during the time period. CONCLUSIONS: STARHS testing of samples from large serial cross-sectional surveys can provide important data for the assessment of community-level HIV prevention.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess trends in HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV) and HIV/HCV infection among injecting drug users (IDU) from 1990 to 2001 in New York City. The 1990-2001 time period included a very large expansion of syringe exchange in New York City, from 250,000 to 3,000,000 syringes exchanged annually. METHODS: Cross-sectional seroprevalence surveys of IDU entering drug abuse treatment in New York City, with sample sizes for HCV of 72 in 1990-1991 and 412 in 2000-2001. A structured risk behavior questionnaire was administered, and HIV and HCV testing were conducted. HCV testing was performed on de-linked stored serum samples. RESULTS: Over the 1990-2001 period, HIV prevalence declined from 54 to 13%. HCV prevalence declined from 80 to 59% among HIV-seronegative individuals, and from 90 to 63% overall. The estimated HCV incidence in 2000-2001 among new injectors was 18 per 100 person-years at risk. CONCLUSIONS: The large-scale expansion of syringe exchange was temporally associated with large reductions in both HIV and HCV prevalence. The prevalence and incidence of HCV, however, still remain at high levels among IDU in New York City.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study assessed recent trends in HIV seroprevalence among injecting drug users in New York City. METHODS: We analyzed temporal trends in HIV seroprevalence from 1991 through 1996 in 5 studies of injecting drug users recruited from a detoxification program, a methadone maintenance program, research storefronts in the Lower East Side and Harlem areas, and a citywide network of sexually transmitted disease clinics. A total of 11,334 serum samples were tested. RESULTS: From 1991 through 1996, HIV seroprevalence declined substantially among subjects in all 5 studies: from 53% to 36% in the detoxification program, from 45% to 29% in the methadone program, from 44% to 22% at the Lower East Side storefront, from 48% to 21% at the Harlem storefront, and from 30% to 21% in the sexually transmitted disease clinics (all P < .002 by chi 2 tests for trend). CONCLUSIONS: The reductions in HIV seroprevalence seen among injecting drug users in New York City from 1991 through 1996 indicate a new phase in this large HIV epidemic. Potential explanatory factors include the loss of HIV-seropositive individuals through disability and death and lower rates of risk behavior leading to low HIV incidence.

AB  - We examined the diffusion of the D.A.R.E program to reduce use of illicit drugs among school-aged children and youths and the diffusion of syringe exchange programs to reduce HIV transmission among injection drug users. The D.A.R.E program was diffused widely in the United States despite a lack of evidence for its effectiveness; there has been limited diffusion of syringe exchange in the United States, despite extensive scientific evidence for its effectiveness. Multiple possible associations between diffusion and evidence of effectiveness exist, from widespread diffusion without evidence of effectiveness to limited diffusion with strong evidence of effectiveness. The decision theory concepts of framing and loss aversion may be useful for further research on the diffusion of public health innovations.

AB  - The variation in Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) as a clinical manifestation of HIV infection has been 1 of the more puzzling aspects of the AIDS epidemic in the US. The proportion of AIDS cases with KS has been highest in the homosexual/bisexual male risk group, for reasons unknown. Over the past few years there has been a sharp decline in KS as a proportion of AIDS cases: KS (without other AIDS diagnoses) was the initial diagnosis in 1/3 of the 1st 1000 cases of AIDS reported to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC); in 1/4 of the 16,500 cases reported up to the end of January, 1986; and in only 1/10 of the 11,000 cases reported to CDC between January and August, 1987. Compared to other AIDS diagnoses, KS is associated with both longer survival times after diagnosis and lower medical costs. Thus, understanding of the trend in proportion of KS cases is needed both for possible insight into the pathogenesis of HIV infection and for planning health services for AIDS. The almost total absence of KS in the heterosexual partners suggests that some co-factor is necessary for the development of KS in the presence of HIV infection. If KS were simply an early response to HIV infection, then the proportion of KS cases in the heterosexual partner group should be very high. 1 explanation is that HIV had spread to more and more people in different groups who have not been sufficiently exposed to the co-factor. Rather than reflecting equivalent risk reduction in different groups, the delines in the proportions of KS among recent AIDS cases probably represent wider spread of HIV before any conscious risk reduction.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe beliefs about remaining HIV-seronegative in injecting drug users in two high-seroprevalence cities, and to consider implications of these beliefs for ongoing risk reduction efforts and for HIV vaccine efficacy trials. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey with open- and closed-ended questions. SUBJECTS: 58 HIV-seronegative injecting drug users participating in HIV vaccine preparation cohort studies in New York City, New York, U.S.A., and Bangkok, Thailand. MAJOR FINDINGS: Large majorities of subjects in Bangkok (90%) and in New York (89%) believed their "own efforts" to practice safer injection methods and safer sex were very important in avoiding HIV infection. More Bangkok subjects (30%) believed that they would "probably" become infected with HIV in the future than New York subjects (4%). Three percent of Bangkok subjects and 70% of New York subjects believed "having an immune system strong enough to avoid becoming infected with HIV despite exposure to the virus" was very important in avoiding HIV infection. This belief in New York subjects was associated with having previously engaged in high-risk behaviors (i.e., sharing injection equipment, unprotected sex, or both) with partners known to be HIV-seropositive. CONCLUSIONS: Risk reduction programming for high-HIV-seroprevalence populations and within HIV vaccine trials should address not only specific HIV risk behaviors, but also the complex belief systems about avoiding HIV infection that develop within such groups. The person's "own efforts/self-efficacy" appears to be central in the psychology of risk reduction. Members of some high-risk populations may overestimate greatly the frequency of any possible natural immunity to becoming infected with HIV. Prevention programs for these populations will need to address explicitly the probabilistic nature of HIV transmission.
Both New York City and Bangkok have experienced rapid, large-scale HIV epidemics among their IV drug using populations. The authors surveyed 58 HIV-seronegative IV drug users (IVDUs) participating in HIV vaccine preparation cohort studies in the two cities to gain insight into their beliefs about remaining HIV-seronegative. The 28 IVDUs in New York City and 30 IVDUs in Bangkok were recruited from ongoing cohort studies of HIV incidence among IVDUs in these cities. The New York cohort subjects were 76% male, 30% White, 27% Black, 43% Latino, and of median age 42 years. The majority had injected both heroin and cocaine. The Bangkok cohort subjects were 94% male, 100% Thai, of mean age 32 years, and almost all had injected heroin only. 89% of the subjects in New York City and 90% in Bangkok believed that their own efforts to practice safer injection methods and safer sex were very important in avoiding HIV infection. However, 4% of New York subjects and 30% of Bangkok subjects thought that they would probably become infected with HIV in the future. 70% of New York subjects and 3% of Bangkok subjects believed that having an immune system strong enough to avoid becoming infected with HIV despite exposure was very important in avoiding HIV infection. This latter belief among New York subjects was associated with having previously engaged in high-risk behaviors with partners known to be HIV-seropositive. Risk reduction programming for such populations and within HIV vaccine trials must take into account the prevailing belief systems about avoiding HIV infection.

AB  - We examined crack use in a cohort of methadone patients originally enrolled in 1984-86. Crack use questions were added to the study in 1987. Of the 494 methadone patients originally enrolled, 228 subjects remained in methadone and were re-interviewed in 1987-88, and 234 remained in methadone and were re-interviewed in 1988-89. Approximately one-quarter of the subjects were using crack at each of the 1987-88 and 1988-89 data collection points, and only 3% of the subjects were using crack at daily or greater frequencies at each of the 1987-88 and 1988-89 interviews. Concurrent crack use was associated with (a) the number of noninjected drugs being used; (b) the number of IV drug-using sexual partners; (c) drug injection; and (d) the use of nonheroin opiates. Persistent crack use, defined as use in both 1987-88 and 1988-89, was associated with previous noninjected drug use and previous suicide attempts. While the potential problem of crack use among methadone patients should not be minimized, it appears that, compared to illicit drug injectors not in treatment, being in methadone maintenance may offer a protective effect against crack use.

Based on a study of persons receiving treatment for HIV infection, this new definition would lead to an estimated 50% increase in the number of persons recognized as living with AIDS. Among 440 HIV-seropositive research subjects recruited from drug treatment programs and through street outreach in New York City, 59 met this definition, yet only 25% of those had been reported to the New York City AIDS registry. The new definition, if combined with HIV and T-cell testing at drug treatment and street outreach programs, could thus yield very large increases in the number of injecting drug users meeting the new surveillance definition of AIDS.

AB  - Illicit drug injection is a major component of the AIDS epidemic in the United States, Europe and some developing countries. Prevention of illicit drug injection would not only reduce HIV transmission but would also reduce the other health, psychological and social problems associated with illicit drug injection. One hundred and four subjects who were using heroin intranasally ('sniffing') were recruited for a study of the transition to drug injection. Eligibility criteria included sniffing as the most frequent route of administration and no more than 60 injections in the past 2 years. All subjects received thorough basic information about AIDS, including HIV antibody test counseling. Subjects were then randomly assigned to a four-session social learning based AIDS/drug injection prevention program or a control condition. Eighty-three subjects were successfully followed at a mean time of 8.9 months. Twenty (24%) of the followed subjects reported injecting illicit drugs during the follow-up period. Drug injection during follow-up was associated with being in the control group, intensity of non-injected drug use, prior injection, and having close personal relationships with current intravenous (IV) drug users.

AB  - New York City, U.S.A., and Bangkok, Thailand experienced two of the most important HIV epidemics among injecting drug users (IDUs) in the world. The epidemic in New York was the first, and by far the largest, HIV epidemic among IDUs. The Bangkok epidemic was notable both for the rapidity of HIV transmission among IDUs and for demonstrating that HIV transmission could occur among IDUs in developing countries. Rapid HIV transmission among IDUs in both cities was followed by large-scale behavior change and stabilization of HIV seroprevalence at high levels. The stabilization of seroprevalence includes unacceptably high rates of continued HIV seroconversions-estimated to be 4 per 100 person-years at risk or greater in both cities. Recent additional HIV prevention efforts in both cities-long-term methadone maintenance treatment in Bangkok and legal access to sterile injection equipment in New York-indicate possibilities for further reducing HIV transmission among IDUs in the two cities.

AB  - Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seroconversion was studied in a group of 173 injection drug users in Bangkok, Thailand, who had been previously tested for HN and were interviewed and retested in the fall of 1989. Ten percent of the group had seroconverted. Two factors protected against HIV seroconversion: having stopped sharing injection equipment in response to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and having a regular sexual partner. The association between self-reported deliberate risk reduction and reduced HIV seroconversion among persons continuing to inject illicit drugs indicates that injection drug users can change their behavior in response to AIDS and will accurately report on the behavior change, and that the changes can protect against HIV infection.

AB  - Legal access to sterile injection equipment has been a primary strategy for preventing the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) among persons who inject illicit drugs in almost all developed countries. This strategy has remained highly controversial in the United States, with only a small number of localities adopting it. This article reviews different techniques of providing legal access-over-the-counter sales and syringe exchanges-research design issues relevant to evaluating legal-access programs, and the findings from the large number of studies conducted to date. The findings are consistent in showing no increase in illicit drug use related to legal access and decreases in AIDS risk behavior related to legal-access programs. The design of legal-access programs for maximal impact and the ultimate effect of the decreases in AIDS risk behavior on transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) remain to be determined.

AB  - Objective. This study assessed the relationship between self-reported acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) behavioral change and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) serostatus among injection drug users. Methods. The study sample involved 4419 injection drug users recruited from drug abuse treatment and nontreatment settings in 11 cities North America, South America, Europe, Asia, and Australia. The World Health Organization multisite risk behavior questionnaire was use, and either blood or saliva samples for HIV testing were obtained. Subjects were asked, ''Since you first heard about AIDS, have,you done anything to avoid getting-AIDS?'' Results. The protective odds ratio for behavioral change against being infected with HIV was 0.50 (95% confidence interval = 0.42, 0.59). While there was important variation across sites, the relationship remained consistent across both demographic and drug use history subgroups. Conclusions. Injection drug users are: capable of modifying their HIV risk behaviors and reporting accurately on behavioral changes. These behavioral changes are associated with their avoidance of HIV infection.

AB  - Objectives.-To describe prevention activities and risk behavior in cities where human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was introduced into the local population of injecting drug users (IDUs), but where seroprevalence has nevertheless remained low (<5%) during at least 5 years. Design and Setting.-A literature search identified five such cities: Glasgow, Scotland; Lund, Sweden; Sydney, New South Wales, Australia; Tacoma, Wash; and Toronto, Ontario, Case histories were prepared for each city, including data on prevention activities and current levels of risk behavior among IDUs. Participants.-Injecting drug users recruited from both drug treatment and nontreatment settings in each city. Interventions.-A variety of HIV prevention activities for IDUs had been implemented in each of the five cities. Results.-There were three common prevention components present in all five cities: (1) implementation of prevention activities when HIV seroprevalence was still low, (2) provision of sterile injection equipment, and (3) community outreach to IDUs, Moderate levels of risk behavior continued with one third or more of the IDUs reporting recent unsafe injections. Conclusions.-In low-seroprevalence areas, it appears possible to severely limit transmission of HIV among populations of IDUs, despite continuing risk behavior among a substantial proportion of the population. Pending further studies, the common prevention components (beginning early, community outreach, and access to sterile injection equipment) should be implemented wherever populations of IDUs are at risk for rapid spread of HIV.

AB  - We examined crack use in a cohort of methadone patients originally enrolled in 1984-86. Crack use questions were added to the study in 1987. Of the 494 methadone patients originally enrolled, 228 subjects remained in methadone and were re-interviewed in 1987-88, and 234 remained in methadone and were re-interviewed in 1988-89. Approximately one-quarter of the subjects were using crack at each of the 1987-88 and 1988-89 data collection points, and only 3 % of the subjects were using crack at daily or greater frequencies at each of the 1987-88 and 1988-89 interviews. Concurrent crack use was associated with (a) the number of noninjected drugs being used; (b) the number of IV drug-using sexual partners; (c) drug injection; and (d) the use of nonheroin opiates. Persistent crack use, defined as use in both 1987-88 and 1988-89, was associated with previous noninjected drug use and previous suicide attempts. While the potential problem of crack use among methadone patients should not be minimized, it appears that, compared to illicit drug injectors not in treatment, being in methadone maintenance may offer a protective effect against crack use.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study examined correlates of prevalent hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection among young adult injection drug users in 2 neighborhoods in New York City. METHODS: Injection drug users aged 18 to 29 years were street recruited from the Lower East Side and Harlem. Participants were interviewed about drug use and sex practices; venipuncture was performed for hepatitis B virus (HBV), HCV, and HIV serologies. RESULTS: In both sites, testing positive for HCV antibody (anti-HCV) was associated with having injected for more than 3 years. Additionally, HCV infection was positively associated with injecting with someone known to have had hepatitis (but the association was significant only in the Lower East Side) and with sharing cotton (but the association was statistically significant only in Harlem). Being in drug treatment and older than 24 years were associated with HCV in the Lower East Side but not in Harlem. Receiving money for sex was associated with anti-HCV positivity in Harlem but not in the Lower East Side. CONCLUSIONS: Several differences in factors associated with prevalent HCV infection existed among 2 populations of young injection drug users from the same city. Indirect transmission of HCV may occur.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In HIV infection, initiation of treatment is associated with improved clinical outcom and reduced rate of sexual transmission. However, difficulty in detecting infection in early stages impairs those benefits. We determined the minimum testing rate that maximizes benefits derived from early diagnosis. METHODS: We developed a mathematical model of HIV infection, diagnosis and treatment that allows studying both diagnosed and undiagnosed populations, as well as determining the impact of modifying time to diagnosis and testing rates. The model's external consistency was assessed by estimating time to AIDS and death in absence of treatment as well as by estimating age-dependent mortality rates during treatment, and comparing them with data previously reported from CASCADE and DHCS cohorts. RESULTS: In our model, life expectancy of patients diagnosed before 8 years post infection is the same as HIV-negative population. After this time point, age at death is significantly dependent on diagnosis delay but initiation of treatment increases life expectancy to similar levels as HIV-negative population. Early mortality during HAART is dependent on treatment CD4 threshold until 6 years post infection and becomes dependent on diagnosis delay after 6 years post infection. By modifying testing rates, we estimate that an annual testing rate of 20% leads to diagnosis of 90% of infected individuals within the first 8.2 years of infection and that current testing rate in middle-high income settings stands close to 10%. In addition, many differences between low-income and middle-high incomes can be predicted by solely modifying the diagnosis delay. CONCLUSIONS: To increase testing rate of undiagnosed HIV population by two-fold in middle-high income settings will minimize early mortality during initiation of treatment and global mortality rate as well as maximize life expectancy. Our results highlight the impact of achieving early diagnosis and the importance of strongly work on improving HIV testing rates.

AB  - The membrane-proximal external region (MPER) of HIV-1 gp41 is highly conserved and critical for the fusogenic ability of the virus. However, little is known about the activity of this region in the context of viral fusion. In this study we investigate the temporal exposure of MPER during the course of HIV-1 Env-mediated fusion. We employed the broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies 2F5 and 4E10, whose epitopes localize to this region as indicators for accessibility to this region. Time of addition experiments indicated that escape of HIV-1 infection inhibition by 2F5 and 4E10 occurred concomitantly with that of C34, a peptide that blocks the six-helix bundle formation and fusion, which was about 20 min later than escape of inhibition by the mAb b12 that blocks CD4-gp120 attachment. We also probed accessibility of the MPER region on fusion intermediates by measuring the binding of the monoclonal antibodies at different time points during the fusion reaction. Immunofluorescence and in-cell Western assays showed that binding of 2F5 and 4E10 decreased upon triggering HIV-1 Env-expressing cells with appropriate target cells. Addition of C34 did not counteract the loss of antibody binding, suggesting that changes in exposure of MPER occur independently of six-helix bundle formation.

AB  - HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein-mediated fusion is driven by the concerted coalescence of the HIV-1 gp41 N- and C-helical regions, which results in the formation of 6-helix bundles. These two regions are considered prime targets for peptides and antibodies that inhibit HIV-1 entry. However, the parameters that govern this inhibition have yet to be elucidated. We address this issue by monitoring the temporal sequence of conformational states of HIV-1 gp41 during the course of HIV-1-mediated cell-cell fusion by quantitative video microscopy using reagents that bind to N- and C-helical regions, respectively. Env-expressing cells were primed by incubation with target cells at different times at 37 degrees C followed by washing. The reactivity of triggered gp41 to the NC-1 monoclonal antibody, which we demonstrate here to bind to N-helical gp41 trimers, increased rapidly to a maximal level in the primed state but decreased once stable fusion junctions had formed. In contrast, reactivity with 5-helix, which binds to the C-helical region of gp41, increased continuously as a function of time following the priming. The peptide N36(Mut(e,g)) reduced NC-1 monoclonal antibody binding and enhanced 5-helix binding, consistent with the notion that this molecule promotes dissociation of gp41 trimers. This inactivation pathway may be important for the design of entry inhibitors and vaccine candidates.

AB  - The N-terminal fusion peptide and the interfacial sequence preceding the transmembrane anchor of HIV-1 gp41 are required for viral fusion. Studies with synthetic peptides indicated that these regions function by destabilizing membranes, which is regarded as a crucial step in the membrane fusion reaction. However, it is not clear whether membrane destabilization is induced by these sequences in the intact gp41. We address this question by examining fusion and destabilization of membranes expressing HIV-1(IIIB) wild-type Env and two mutant Envs. (1) A Glu residue at position 2 of the gp41 fusion peptide is substituted for Val (V2E) to produce one mutant. (2) Residues 665-682 in the membrane-proximal domain are deleted to form the other. The process of membrane destabilization was monitored by the influx of Sytox, an impermeant fluorescent dye, into the Env-expressing cells following the interaction with CD4-CXCR4 complexes, and fusion was monitored by observing dye transfer between Env-expressing cells and appropriate target cells. We also monitored the conformational changes in the Envs following their interactions with CD4 and CXCR4 by immunofluorescence using an anti-gp41 mAb that reacts with the six-helix bundle. In contrast to the wild type, both Env mutants did not mediate cell fusion. The V2E Env did not mediate membrane destabilization. However, the Env with an unmodified fusion peptide but with a deletion of residues 665-682 in the membrane-proximal domain did mediate membrane destabilization. The wild type and both mutant Envs undergo conformational changes detected by the anti-gp41 six-helix bundle mAbs. Our results suggest that in intact HIV-1 Env the membrane-proximal domain is not required for membrane perturbations, but rather enables the bending of gp41 that is required for viral and target membranes to come together. Moreover, the observation that the Delta665-683 Env self-inserts its fusion peptide but does not cause fusion suggests that self-insertion of the fusion peptide is not sufficient for HIV-1 Env-mediated fusion.

AB  - An early step in the process of HIV-1 entry into target cells is the activation of its envelope glycoprotein (GP120-GP41) to a fusogenic state upon binding to target cell CD4 and cognate co-receptor. Incubation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 Env-expressing cells with an excess of CD4 and co-recepeptor-bearing target cells resulted in an influx of an impermeant nucleic acid-staining fluorescent dye into the Env-expressing cells. The dye influx occurred concomitant with cell fusion. No influx of dye into target cells was observed if they were incubated with an excess of Env-expressing cells. The permeabilization of Env-expressing cells was also triggered by CD4.co-receptor complexes attached to Protein G-Sepharose beads in the absence of target cells. The CD4 and co-receptor-induced permeabilization of Env-expressing cells occurred with the same specificity with respect to co-receptor usage as cell fusion. Natural ligands for the co-receptors and C-terminal GP41 peptide inhibitors of HIV-1 fusion blocked this effect. Our results indicate that the process of HIV-1 Env-mediated fusion is initiated by the destabilization of HIV-1 Env-expressing membranes. Further elucidation of these early intermediates may help identify and develop potential inhibitors of HIV-1 entry into cells.

AB  - The fusion kinetics of cells expressing the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope glycoprotein with CD4 target cells was continuously monitored by image-enhanced Nomarski differential interference contrast optics. The analysis of the videotape recordings showed that (i) cells made contact relatively rapidly (within minutes), in many cases by using microspikes to "touch" and adhere to adjoining cells; (ii) the adhered cells fused after a relatively long waiting period, which varied from 15 min to hours; (iii) the morphological changes after membrane fusion, which led to disappearance of the interface separating the two cells, were rapid (less than 1 min); and (iv) the process of syncytium formation involved subsequent fusion with other cells and not simultaneous fusion of many cells. To measure the kinetics of early stages of cell fusion, we used the recently developed very stable membrane-soluble dye, PKH26, which redistributes between labeled and unlabeled membranes after fusion but does not exchange spontaneously between membranes for prolonged periods. We found that photoactivation of this dye by illumination with green light inhibits fusion of cell membranes as indicated by the lack of dye transfer from the labeled HIV-1 envelope-expressing cells to unlabeled CD4 cells. The inhibitory effect was localized in space and time, which allowed us to develop a new assay for measuring the kinetics of membrane fusion by illuminating the cell mixture at different times after coculture. This assay has also been used to monitor the fusion kinetics of HIV-1 and recombinant vaccinia virus. The photoactivation of nonexchangeable membrane-soluble fluorescent dyes may be useful for development of new assays for measuring the kinetics of membrane fusion and could also be important in designing new antiviral approaches.

AB  - Calcium ions are required for fusion of a wide variety of artificial and biological membranes. To examine the role of calcium ions for cell fusion mediated by interactions between CD4 and the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope glycoprotein (gp120-gp41), we used two experimental systems: (i) cells expressing gp120-gp41 and its receptor CD4, both encoded by recombinant vaccinia viruses, and (ii) chronically infected cells producing low levels of HIV-1. Fusion was measured by counting the number of syncytia and by monitoring the redistribution of fluorescence dyes by video microscopy. Syncytia did not form in solutions without calcium ions. Addition of calcium ions partially restored the formation of syncytia. EDTA and EGTA [ethylene glycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid] blocked syncytium formation in culture media containing calcium ions. Membrane fusion as monitored by fluorescence dye redistribution also required calcium ions. Cell fusion increased with an increase in calcium ion concentration from 100 microM to 10 mM but was not affected by magnesium ions in the concentration range from 0 to 30 mM. Fibrinogen and fibronectin did not promote fusion in the absence or presence of Ca2+. Binding of soluble CD4 to gp120-gp41-expressing cells was not affected by Ca2+ and Mg2+. We conclude that Ca2+ is involved in postbinding steps in cell fusion mediated by the CD4-HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein interaction.

AB  - Membrane fusion is an essential step in the infection of permissive cells with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Infected cells frequently fuse with each other, and then progress to form multinucleated giant cells (syncytia). To gain insight into mechanisms of HIV env-mediated membrane fusion, we developed a new assay for studying the initial events. The assay is based on the redistribution of fluorescent markers between membranes and cytoplasm of adjacent cells examined by means of fluorescence video microscopy. Membrane fusion between HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (gp120/41) expressing effector cells and CD4+ target cells was observed 90 min after the association of cells, whereas the first syncytia only became apparent after 5 h. Moreover, membrane fusion events were observed under conditions where no syncytia were detected, for example, when the effector:target cell ratio was greater than 100:1, or less than 1:100. A significant number of cells with fused membranes were not involved in the syncytia. In order to determine whether quantitative differences in receptor expression might influence the extent of membrane fusion, we used laboratory-selected variants of CEM cells that differ in their expression of CD4. We found that CD4 is required on the target membrane for HIV env-mediated membrane fusion, but its extent is only partially dependent on CD4 surface concentration. The ability of those CEM variants to take part in HIV env-mediated membrane fusion did not correlate with their capacity to form syncytia. These findings indicate that additional steps are needed to form syncytia after membrane fusion.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To study the kinetics of the interactions between soluble (s) CD4 and HIV-1-Env-expressing cells in relation to subsequent events leading to cell fusion and inhibition of syncytia formation. DESIGN: Vaccinia-HIV-1 (Env)-infected CD4- T-cells were used to study the kinetics of sCD4-gp120/41 interactions and syncytia formation (with CD4+ T-cells) under identical conditions. METHODS: sCD4 association and dissociation rates for HIV-1-Env-expressing cells, and quantification of sCD4-induced gp120 shedding was determined by a quantitative flow cytometry assay. Syncytia inhibition was measured in the continuous presence of sCD4, or after washing of HIV-1-Env-expressing cells following pre-incubation with sCD4. RESULTS: The kinetics of syncytia inhibition correlated with sCD4 binding when sCD4 was maintained during the culture. When Env-expressing cells, which had been pre-incubated with sCD4, were washed to remove unbound sCD4, no syncytia formation inhibition was observed, even following sCD4-induced shedding of greater than 50% of surface gp120 molecules. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of syncytia inhibition seen after removal of unbound sCD4, even after pre-incubation of cells under saturation and gp120 shedding conditions, indicated that sufficient numbers of fusogenic molecules remained on the sCD4-treated cells. In addition, fast dissociation of pre-bound sCD4 occurred in culture. These results are important for understanding HIV-1-Env-mediated cell fusion and AIDS therapy.

AB  - The mechanisms of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) entry into CD4+ cells and HIV-1 inactivation by sCD4 were studied by analyzing the kinetics of inhibition of viral infection by sCD4 and the kinetics of fusion of CD4+ cells with intact virions labeled with the lipid fluorophore octadecylrhodamine (R18). sCD4 inhibited HIV-1 infection much more effectively when preincubated with virus prior to interaction with CD4+ cells than when mixed simultaneously with virions and cells. The kinetics of inhibition of infection was much slower at 4 degrees and at low sCD4 concentrations than at 37 degrees and at high sCD4 concentrations. In the absence of sCD4, attachment of virus to cells leading to productive infection occurred within 10-30 min. Fusion of the virions with cells started after a 1-2 min lag time and was complete within 15 min. In high-density cell suspensions (5 x 10(7) cells/ml), even very high sCD4 concentrations (100 micrograms/ml) failed to block viral infection during simultaneous mixing of cells, sCD4 and HIV-1. We conclude that the kinetics of sCD4-virus interaction and the competition of sCD4 with the cell surface associated CD4 for the virus are crucial factors in the inhibition of HIV-1 infection by sCD4. These results provide insight into mechanisms of viral penetration into cells and should be considered when designing new approaches for AIDS therapy.

AB  - Tissue culture infections of CD4-positive human T cells by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) proceed in three stages: (i) a period following the initiation of an infection during which no detectable virus is produced; (ii) a phase in which a sharp increase followed by a peak of released progeny virions can be measured; and (iii) a final period when virus production declines. In this study, we have derived equations describing the kinetics of HIV-1 accumulation in cell culture supernatants during multiple rounds of infection. Our analyses indicated that the critical parameter affecting the kinetics of HIV-1 infection is the infection rate constant k = Inn/ti, where n is the number of infectious virions produced by one cell (about 10(2)) and ti is the time required for one complete cycle of virus infection (typically 3 to 4 days). Of particular note was our finding that the infectivity of HIV-1 during cell-to-cell transmission is 10(2) to 10(3) times greater than the infectivity of cell-free virus stocks, the inocula commonly used to initiate tissue culture infections. We also demonstrated that the slow infection kinetics of an HIV-1 tat mutant is not due to a longer replication time but reflects the small number of infectious particles produced per cycle.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dignity is a complex concept necessary for the adequate treatment of patients in the healthcare setting. Autonomy, self-sufficiency, respect, and equality are concepts used to define dignity. Dignity has not been studied in people who inject drugs (PWID). OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine how PWID maintain or have their dignity threatened during hospitalization in an acute care unit. DESIGN: The qualitative descriptive study was a deductive thematic analysis of secondary data on PWID experiences with received nursing care. In-depth, semistructured interviews were conducted and transcribed verbatim with a constant comparison method for thematic analysis using NVivo. A priori codes of dignity concepts from the literature and dignity scales were used as a guide to examine the nine qualitative transcripts. FINDINGS: The three most common threats to dignity during hospitalization were lack of equality compared with other patients, not feeling valued as an individual, and not feeling respected by the healthcare workers providing care. The three most common protectors of dignity were feeling respected by healthcare workers, having autonomy in treatment choices, and feeling valued as an individual. CONCLUSIONS: Protecting dignity significantly affects whether PWID are willing to seek healthcare in the hospital setting. Preserving dignity in PWID during their hospitalizations can encourage this population to seek care earlier. Nurses must be experienced in caring for PWID and provide nonjudgmental care for this population.

AB  - This report describes a case of teriparatide (TPTD) therapy for bisphosphonate (BP)-related osteonecrosis of the jaw induced after implant placement. A 75-year-old woman taking oral BP was referred with uncontrolled osteonecrosis of the mandible related to the implant placement. With conservative treatment, BP was suspended and daily subcutaneous injections of 20 μm/d TPTD were started. After 4 months of the therapy, fixture removal and sequestrectomy were performed. Histological analysis revealed necrotic lamellar bone and empty osteocytic lacunae. In contrast, multiple irregular reversal lines of the lamellar bone and active osteoblasts were noted adjacent to the lesion. There was a significant increase in serum C-terminal telopeptide cross-link of type 1 collagen and serum osteocalcin after commencement of the therapy. After 7 months off therapy, the serum levels of the 2 markers remained at a high level compared with the baseline.

AB  - Recent interest by physicists in social networks and disease transmission factors has prompted debate over the topology of degree distributions in sexual networks. Social network researchers have been critical of "scale-free" Barabasi-Albert approaches, and largely rejected the preferential attachment, "rich-get-richer" assumptions that underlie that model. Instead, research on sexual networks has pointed to the importance of homophily and local sexual norms in dictating degree distributions, and thus disease transmission thresholds. Injecting Drug User (IDU) network topologies may differ from the emerging models of sexual networks, however. Degree distribution analysis of a Brooklyn, NY, IDU network indicates a different topology than the spanning tree configurations discussed for sexual networks, instead featuring comparatively short cycles and high concurrency. Our findings suggest that IDU networks do in some ways conform to a "scale-free" topology, and thus may represent "reservoirs" of potential infection despite seemingly low transmission thresholds.

AB  - This article explores how social network dynamics may have reduced the spread of HIV-1 infection among people who inject drugs during the early years of the epidemic. Stochastic, discrete event, agent-based simulations are used to test whether a "firewall effect" can arise out of self-organizing processes at the actor level, and whether such an effect can account for stable HIV prevalence rates below population saturation. Repeated simulation experiments show that, in the presence of recurring, acute, and highly infectious outbreaks, micro-network structures combine with the HIV virus's natural history to reduce the spread of the disease. These results indicate that network factors likely played a significant role in the prevention of HIV infection within injection risk networks during periods of peak prevalence. They also suggest that social forces that disturb network connections may diminish the natural firewall effect and result in higher rates of HIV.

AB  - Patterns of risk in injecting drug user (IDU) networks have been a key focus of network approaches to HIV transmission histories. New network modeling techniques allow for a reexamination of these patterns with greater statistical accuracy and the comparative weighting of model elements. This paper describes the results of a reexamination of network data from the SFHR and P90 data sets using Exponential Random Graph Modeling. The results show that "transitive closure" is an important feature of IDU network topologies, and provides relative importance measures for race/ethnicity, age, gender, and number of risk partners in predicting risk relationships.

AB  - Black sexual minority men (SMM) in the Deep South are heavily impacted by HIV; yet studies fail to consider discordance across aspects of sexual orientation (i.e., identity, attraction, behavior) or how a lack of concordance enhances vulnerability to HIV. We sought to explore the overlap across aspects of sexual orientation and examine associations between each aspect and the number of sexual partners who engaged in HIV vulnerability-enhancing behaviors, and HIV prevention and care outcomes. A total of 204 Black SMM completed surveys, reporting their sexual identity, attraction, and behavior (i.e., sex with men only vs. sex with men and women), number of condomless sex or transactional sex (e.g., buyers vs. sellers) partners in the past 6 months, and adherence to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) or antiretroviral therapy (ART) among users. Less than one in four participants (22.5%) reported overlap in same-sex sexual orientations, while 17.1% of bisexual men reported overlap across aspects. In multivariable models, differences were found in how aspects of sexual orientation were associated with the number of partners who bought or sold sex; as well as how often participants tested for HIV in the past 12 months. Results suggest different aspects of sexual orientation have implications for addressing HIV among Black SMM in the Deep South.

AB  - Background: In many parts of the world, stark racial disparities in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevalence, incidence, prevention, and care outcomes persist among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM), with Black MSM significantly impacted in the United States (U.S.). Individual-level characteristics, including sexual behaviors and socioeconomic status, do not fully account for racial/ethnic disparities in HIV among MSM. We hypothesize that neighborhood contexts and network characteristics influence risk for HIV infection as well as HIV-related prevention and care behaviors. As such, the study design includes the use of real-time geospatial methods and in-depth assessments of multiple network typologies to investigate the impact of neighborhood and network-level factors on HIV prevention and treatment among Black MSM residing in longstanding priority HIV elimination areas in the U.S., namely Chicago, Illinois and in the Deep South (Jackson, Mississippi and New Orleans, Louisiana) (n = 450, n = 50, and n = 100, respectively). We describe the design, sampling methods, data collection, data management methods, and preliminary findings of the ongoing 'Neighborhoods and Networks (N2) Cohort Study'. Methods/Design: N2 employs a prospective longitudinal design. The sample includes Black MSM participants in Chicago recruited via respondent-driven sampling and assessed every six months over two years of follow-up. Participants enrolled in Jackson and New Orleans are being recruited through existing health and community services and assessed every six months over one year of follow-up. Mobility within and between neighborhoods is being assessed using global positioning system (GPS) technology. Social and sexual networks among Black MSM are being studied through egocentric network inventories as well as newer methods of creating meso-level networks that involve social media (Facebook) and mobile phone contacts. Key HIV prevention outcomes such as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) care engagement, and HIV/STI (sexually transmitted infections) biomarkers will be examined at baseline and follow-up. Results: As of 31 December 2018, a total of 361 men were enrolled across all study sites: 259 in Chicago and 102 in the Deep South (75 in New Orleans and 27 in Jackson). At baseline, participants ranged in age from 17 to 65 years old (mean = 34.3, standard deviation = 5.1) with 123 men (34.1%) self-reported as HIV positive. While HIV treatment levels were similar between sites, men in the Deep South reported higher rates of adherence than men in Chicago (63.3% versus 49.4%, p = 0.03). Sexual risk profiles were mainly the same between men from different study sites, with 22.9% of men in Chicago and 28.9% in the Deep South reporting consistent condom use during vaginal and anal sex (p = 0.26). Regarding their home neighborhoods, men in the Deep South were more likely than those in Chicago to characterize theirs as having a good reputation (43.1% versus 24.7%, p < 0.001) and as being safe (37.3% versus 21.2%, p = 0.002). Conclusions: The focus on Black MSM in the N2 Study will allow for a nuanced exploration of the attitudes, beliefs, behaviors, and practices of a diverse group of Black MSM. The study is also positioned to provide novel insight about neighborhood and network characteristics that influence HIV-related behaviors. A health equity framework ensures that Black MSM are not explicitly or implicitly deemed as deviant, disordered, or the non-reference group. Findings from N2 will provide guidance for the implementation of more impactful HIV prevention interventions that engage a diverse population of Black MSM as we work toward HIV elimination in the U.S.

AB  - BACKGROUND: No global positioning system (GPS) technology study has been conducted among a sample of young gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (YMSM). As such, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of using GPS methods to understand the spatial context of substance use and sexual risk behaviors among a sample of YMSM in New York City, a high-risk population. METHODS: Data came from a subsample of the ongoing P18 Cohort Study (n = 75). GPS feasibility and acceptability among participants was measured with: 1) a pre- and post-survey and 2) adherence to the GPS protocol which included returning the GPS device, self-report of charging and carrying the GPS device as well as objective data analyzed from the GPS devices. Analyses of the feasibility surveys were treated as repeated measures as each participant had a pre- and post-feasibility survey. When comparing the similar GPS survey items asked at baseline and at follow-up, we present percentages and associated p-values based on chi-square statistics. RESULTS: Participants reported high ratings of pre-GPS acceptability, ease of use, and low levels of wear-related concerns in addition to few concerns related to safety, loss, or appearance, which were maintained after baseline GPS feasibility data collection. The GPS return rate was 100%. Most participants charged and carried the GPS device on most days. Of the total of 75 participants with GPS data, 75 (100%) have at least one hour of GPS data for one day and 63 (84%) had at least one hour on all 7 days. CONCLUSIONS: Results from this pilot study demonstrate that utilizing GPS methods among YMSM is feasible and acceptable. GPS devices may be used in spatial epidemiology research in YMSM populations to understand place-based determinants of health such as substance use and sexual risk behaviors.

AB  - This review describes the numerous and innovative methods used to study the structure and function of viral fusion peptides. The systems studied include both intact fusion proteins and synthetic peptides interacting with model membranes. The strategies and methods include dissecting the fusion process into intermediate stages, comparing the effects of sequence mutations, electrophysiological patch clamp methods, hydrophobic photolabelling, video microscopy of the redistribution of both aqueous and lipophilic fluorescent probes between cells, standard optical spectroscopy of peptides in solution (circular dichroism and fluorescence) and attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy of peptides bound to planar bilayers. Although the goal of a detailed picture of the fusion pore has not been achieved for any of the intermediate stages, important properties useful for constraining the development of models are emerging. For example, the presence of alpha-helical structure in at least part of the fusion peptide is strongly correlated with activity; whereas, beta-structure tends to be less prevalent, associated with non-native experimental conditions, and more related to vesicle aggregation than fusion. The specific angle of insertion of the peptides into the membrane plane is also found to be an important characteristic for the fusion process. A shallow penetration, extending only to the central aliphatic core region, is likely responsible for the destabilization of the lipids required for coalescence of the apposing membranes and fusion. The functional role of the fusion peptides (which tend to be either nonpolar or aliphatic) is then to bind to and dehydrate the outer bilayers at a localized site; and thus reduce the energy barrier for the formation of highly curved, lipidic 'stalk' intermediates. In addition, the importance of the formation of specific, 'higher-order' fusion peptide complexes has also been shown. Recent crystallographic structures of core domains of two more fusion proteins (in addition to influenza haemagglutinin) has greatly facilitated the development of prototypic models of the fusion site. This latter effort will undoubtedly benefit from the insights and constraints gained from the studies of fusion peptides.

AB  - We described drug use, sex risk, and STI/HIV among men who have sex with men and women (MSMW) and their female partners. We used the Network, Norms and HIV/STI Risk among Youth (NNAHRAY) study to evaluate drug use, sex risk, and biologically-confirmed STI/HIV in (1) MSMW and men who had sex with men only (MSMO) versus men who had sex with women only (MSWO) and (2) female partners of MSMW versus female partners of MSWO (N = 182 men, 152 women). MSMW versus MSWO had 30 to 60% increased odds of substance use, over twice the odds of multiple partnerships, and almost five times the odds of sex trade and HIV infection. Female partners of MSMW versus female partners of MSWO had approximately twice the odds of substance use and 1.5-2 times the odds of multiple partnerships and sex trade. Interventions should address STI/HIV risk among MSMW and their female partners.

AB  - This paper discusses organizations of the oppressed, such as drug user and sex worker groups, and the images of themselves that they construct. We suggest that analysis of these organizationally-produced collective self-images -frequently overlooked in scholarly research -is crucial to understanding the complex internal dynamics of users' and sex workers' organizations and struggles they engage in when defining their collective (organizational) identities and course of action.

AB  - Background: Increased drug use has disproportionately impacted rural areas across the U.S. People who use drugs are at risk of overdose and other medical complications, including infectious diseases. Understanding barriers to healthcare access for this often stigmatized population is key to reducing morbidity and mortality, particularly in rural settings where resources may be limited. Methods: We conducted 20 semi-structured interviews with people who use drugs, including 17 who inject drugs, in rural southern Illinois between June 2018 and February 2019. Interviews were analyzed using a modified grounded theory approach where themes are coded and organized as they emerge from the data. Results: Participants reported breaches of trust by healthcare providers, often involving law enforcement and Emergency Medical Services, that dissuaded them from accessing medical care. Participants described experiences of mistreatment in emergency departments, with one account of forced catheterization. They further recounted disclosures of protected health information by healthcare providers, including communicating drug test results to law enforcement and sharing details of counseling sessions with community members without consent. Participants also described a hesitancy common among people who use drugs to call emergency medical services for an overdose due to fear of arrest. Conclusion: Breaches of trust by healthcare providers in rural communities discouraged people who use drugs from accessing medical care until absolutely necessary, if at all. These experiences may worsen healthcare outcomes and further stigmatize this marginalized community. Structural changes including reforming and clarifying law enforcement's role in Emergency Departments as well as instituting diversion policies during arrests may help rebuild trust in these communities. Other possible areas for intervention include stigma training and harm reduction education for emergency medicine providers, as well as developing and implementing referral systems between Emergency Departments and local harm reduction providers and medically assisted drug treatment programs.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Evaluate intravitreal 0.5 mg ranibizumab or 4 mg triamcinolone combined with focal/grid laser compared with focal/grid laser alone for treatment of diabetic macular edema (DME). DESIGN: Multicenter, randomized clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 854 study eyes of 691 participants with visual acuity (approximate Snellen equivalent) of 20/32 to 20/320 and DME involving the fovea. METHODS: Eyes were randomized to sham injection + prompt laser (n=293), 0.5 mg ranibizumab + prompt laser (n=187), 0.5 mg ranibizumab + deferred (> or =24 weeks) laser (n=188), or 4 mg triamcinolone + prompt laser (n=186). Retreatment followed an algorithm facilitated by a web-based, real-time data-entry system. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Best-corrected visual acuity and safety at 1 year. RESULTS: The 1-year mean change (+/-standard deviation) in the visual acuity letter score from baseline was significantly greater in the ranibizumab + prompt laser group (+9+/-11, P<0.001) and ranibizumab + deferred laser group (+9+/-12, P<0.001) but not in the triamcinolone + prompt laser group (+4+/-13, P=0.31) compared with the sham + prompt laser group (+3+/-13). Reduction in mean central subfield thickness in the triamcinolone + prompt laser group was similar to both ranibizumab groups and greater than in the sham + prompt laser group. In the subset of pseudophakic eyes at baseline (n=273), visual acuity improvement in the triamcinolone + prompt laser group appeared comparable to that in the ranibizumab groups. No systemic events attributable to study treatment were apparent. Three eyes (0.8%) had injection-related endophthalmitis in the ranibizumab groups, whereas elevated intraocular pressure and cataract surgery were more frequent in the triamcinolone + prompt laser group. Two-year visual acuity outcomes were similar to 1-year outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Intravitreal ranibizumab with prompt or deferred laser is more effective through at least 1 year compared with prompt laser alone for the treatment of DME involving the central macula. Ranibizumab as applied in this study, although uncommonly associated with endophthalmitis, should be considered for patients with DME and characteristics similar to those in this clinical trial. In pseudophakic eyes, intravitreal triamcinolone + prompt laser seems more effective than laser alone but frequently increases the risk of intraocular pressure elevation.

AB  - A recombinant vaccinia virus was used to express a mutation in the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope glycoprotein gp120-gp41. In this mutant protein, the second amino acid in the N-terminal region of gp41 has been converted from a hydrophobic valine residue to the polar glutamate. When recombinant vaccinia viruses encoding wild-type HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein infect a lymphocyte cell line lacking CD4, the cells express the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120-gp41 and are able to fuse with a CD4(4) T lymphocyte cell line. Cells expressing the mutant envelope glycoprotein are unable to fuse with CD4(4) T lymphocytes. When both viruses infect CD4- cells simultaneously, there is an inhibition of fusion to CD4+ cells with an increasing fraction of the virus encoding the mutated envelope glycoprotein. Interestingly, when the opposing, or CD4+ target cells are infected with the mutation-expressing virus, while CD4- cells are infected with wild-type envelope-expressing virus, a similar inhibition of fusion is observed. This suggests that the mutated envelope glycoprotein does not need to reside in the same membrane as the wild-type protein it inhibits.

AB  - Self-sealing hyaluronic acid (HA)-coated self-sealing 30-gauge needles exhibiting instant leakage prevention of intravitreal humor and injected drug were developed in this study. Ninety New Zealand rabbits were used in this study. We assessed dye regurgitation in intravitreal ICG dye injections using HA-coated needles (HA needle group) and conventional needles (control group). Vitreous humor levels of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were compared between groups one, three, and seven days after intravitreal bevacizumab (0.016 mL) injections. Expression levels of inflammatory cytokines in the aqueous humor and vitreous humor, including prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)), interferon-γ, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-4, IL-6, IL-17, and IL-8, were compared between HA needle, control, and normal (in which intravitreal injection was not performed) groups following 12 intravitreal injections over a period of one week. In the HA needle group, HA remained at the injection site and blocked the hole after intravitreal injection. Dye regurgitation occurred significantly less frequently in the HA needle group (16.7%) than the control group (55.6%) after intravitreal ICG dye injection. Meanwhile, vitreous anti-VEGF levels were markedly higher in the HA needle group than the control group one and three days after intravitreal bevacizumab injections. After 12 intravitreal injections, expression levels of aqueous and vitreous IL-8 significantly increased in the control group compared to the HA needle and normal groups. Conversely, there were no significant differences in the expression of the other seven cytokines among the three groups. Intravitreal injections using HA-coated self-sealing 30-gauge needles can block the outflow of vitreous humor and drugs through the needle passage.

AB  - BACKGROUND: People who inject drugs (PWID) are at continued risk for HIV in the U.S., and experience disparities across the HIV care continuum compared to other high-risk groups. Estimates of the risk of HIV transmission at each stage of the care continuum may assist in identifying public health priorities for averting incident infections among PWID, in addition to transmissions to sexual partners of PWID. METHODS: We created an agent-based model simulating HIV transmission and the HIV care continuum for PWID in New York City (NYC) in 2012. To account for sexual transmission arising from PWID to non-PWID, the simulation included the entire adult NYC population. Using surveillance data and estimates from the National HIV Behavioral Surveillance system, we simulated a dynamic sexual and injecting network. We estimated the proportion of HIV transmission events attributable to PWID in the following categories, those: without an HIV diagnosis ('Undiagnosed'); diagnosed but not on antiretroviral therapy (ART) ('Diagnosed - not on ART'); those who initiated ART but were not virally suppressed ('Unsuppressed'); and, those who achieved viral suppression ('Suppressed'). RESULTS: We estimated HIV incidence among PWID to be 113 per 100,000 person-years in 2012, with an overall incidence rate for the entire adult NYC population of 33 per 100,000 person-years. Despite accounting for only 33% of the HIV-infected PWID population, the Undiagnosed were associated with 52.6% (95% simulation interval [95% SI]: 47.1-57.0%) of total transmission events. The Diagnosed - not on ART population contributed the second-largest proportion of HIV transmissions, with 36.6% (95% SI: 32.2-41.5%). The Unsuppressed population contributed 8.7% (95% SI: 5.6-11.8%), and Suppressed 2.1% (95% SI: 1.1-3.9%), relatively little of overall transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Among PWID in NYC, more than half (53%) of transmissions were from those who were unaware of their infection status and more than 36% were due to PWID who knew their status, but were not on treatment. Our results indicate the importance of early diagnosis and interventions to engage diagnosed PWID on treatment to further suppress population-level HIV transmission. Future HIV prevention research should focus on the elimination of identified and potential barriers to the testing, diagnosis, and retention of PWID on HIV treatment.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Estimates for the contribution of transmission arising from acute HIV infections (AHIs) to overall HIV incidence vary significantly. Furthermore, little is known about AHI-attributable transmission among people who inject drugs (PWID), including the extent to which interventions targeting chronic infections (e.g. HAART as prevention) are limited by AHI transmission. Thus, we estimated the proportion of transmission events attributable to AHI within the mature HIV epidemic among PWID in New York City (NYC). DESIGN: Modeling study. METHODS: We constructed an interactive sexual and injecting transmission network using an agent-based model simulating the HIV epidemic in NYC between 1996 and 2012. Using stochastic microsimulations, we cataloged transmission from PWID based on the disease stage of index agents to determine the proportion of infections transmitted during AHI (in primary analyses, assumed to last 3 months). RESULTS: Our calibrated model approximated the epidemiological features of the mature HIV epidemic in NYC between 1996 and 2012. Annual HIV incidence among PWID dropped from approximately 1.8% in 1996 to 0.7% in 2012. Over the 16-year period, AHI accounted for 4.9% (10th/90th percentile: 0.1-12.3%) of incident HIV cases among PWID. The annualized contribution of AHI increased over this period from 3.6% in 1996 to 5.9% in 2012. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that, in mature epidemics such as NYC, between 3% and 6% of transmission events are attributable to AHI among PWID. Current HIV treatment as prevention strategies are unlikely to be substantially affected by AHI-attributable transmission among PWID populations in mature epidemic settings.

AB  - There has been a steep rise in overdoses and mortality among people who use opioids or who inject drugs (PWUD), including in North America, the United Kingdom, and parts of Eastern Europe, with some of the sharpest increases amassing in rural communities. Currently, the literature lacks a comparative focus on the views and experiences of rural PWUD and professionals who regularly work and interface with them, in terms of their understandings of the rural drug use initiation/relapse trajectory. Considering a renewed sociology of emotions and empathy and the constructs of direct experience (e.g., of personal drug use) versus role-playing (e.g., envisioning oneself in another's position), we used a modified constant comparison method to analyze interviews conducted with PWUD and professional stakeholders in rural southern Illinois, an opioid overdose hotspot. Findings suggest that rural opioid use is adopted in service of an intricate interplay of sensory, relational, somatic, and psychosocial benefits, with a sharp divergence between PWUD, who express considerable agency in their drug use behaviors, and professionals, who fail to successful role-play in emphasizing PWUD's limited willpower and "deviant" sociocultural predilection. These dynamics illuminate challenges to advancing nuanced, culturally humble programming to advance public health goals related to the opioid and drug injection epidemic.

AB  - Stigma is a known barrier to treating substance use disorders and dramatically diminishes the quality of life of people who use drugs (PWUD) nonmedically. Stigma against PWUD may be especially pronounced in rural areas due to their decreased anonymity and residents' limited access, or resistance, to "neutralizing" information on factors associated with drug use. Stigma often manifests in the attitudes of professionals whom stigmatized individuals regularly interact with and often materially impact. We analyzed interviews conducted between July 2018 and February 2019 with professional stakeholders in rural southern Illinois who interact with PWUD, specifically those who use opioids nonmedically or who inject drugs (n = 30). We further analyzed interview data from a complementary PWUD sample (n = 22). Interviews addressed perspectives around nonmedical drug use and treatment/harm reduction, with analysis centered around the Framework Integrating Normative Influences on Stigma and its focus on micro, meso and macro level stigmatization processes. Stakeholder participants included professionals from local law enforcement, courts, healthcare organizations, emergency management services, and faith-based and social services organizations. Most stakeholders, particularly law enforcement, negatively perceived PWUD and nonmedical drug use in general, questioned the character, agency and extrinsic value of PWUD, and used labels (e.g. "addict," "abuser," etc.) that may be regarded as stigmatizing. Further, most respondents, including PWUD, characterized their communities as largely unaware or dismissive of the bio-medical and sociocultural explanations for opioid use, drug injection and towards harm reduction services (e.g., syringe exchanges) and naloxone, which were frequently framed as undeserved usages of taxpayer funds. In conclusion, rural stigma against PWUD manifested and was framed as a substantial issue, notably activating at micro, meso and macro levels. Stigma prevention efforts in these communities should aim to improve public knowledge on the intricate factors contributing to opioid use and drug injection and harm reduction programming's moral and fiscal value.

AB  - The study objective was to examine quality oversight efforts by Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs) for children in a sample of ambulatory care institutions and private practices in New York City. This was a cross-sectional study of quality assurance priorities and strategies of MCOs and their impact date in institutions in New York City. Data were from structured interviews administered in 1997 to medical directors in the eight largest MCOs; and medical directors, heads of ambulatory pediatrics, and institutional pediatricians in a random sample of 15 institutions and 20 private office-based providers. Medical directors in MCOs reported that their main priority areas were the preventive care measures (e.g., immunization and lead screening) that they must report to the state. Knowledge of these MCO priority areas and monitoring activities was high for medical directors in the random sample, but decreased from these medical directors to heads of ambulatory pediatrics to institutional pediatricians, with the differences between the medical directors and institutional pediatricians significant (P < .05). However, 96% of the institutional pediatricians reported knowing their own institution's priorities and monitoring activities. In contrast, most private pediatricians reported they knew MCO priorities and monitoring activities (80%). Less than 33% of any group reported activities as "very effective" or felt any incentive to improve performance. There was a high level of overlap in provider networks, with institutions and private providers having children in many MCOs, and MCOs having children in many sites. Conclusions. The current model of quality oversight is producing reports for the state, but is not translating into effective strategies at the provider level. The need to work through the leadership in institutions to influence quality is highlighted. The level of overlap in provider networks suggests the need for collaboration among MCOs in quality monitoring.

AB  - Significant momentum has been recently generated in understanding the HIV fusion process. This has led to the development of a host of HIV entry inhibitors which are currently in preclinical and/or clinical development or have been approved for clinical use. In this review we update our understanding of HIV fusion, specifically highlighting novel mechanisms and agents that inhibit this process. Major focus will be placed on three key areas. Initially viral attachment will be reviewed as recent developments in this field emphasize the importance of understanding cell type specific interactions with HIV. This has aided in identifying promising targets for the development of attachment inhibitors. Secondly, we will review the role of cellular lipids in HIV entry. Glycosphingolipids have been shown to interact with different components of the HIV fusion machinery and agents that perturb glycosphingolipid biosynthesis have inhibitory effects on HIV fusion. Likewise, manipulating ceramide biosynthesis also inhibits HIV fusion. Here, we describe how manipulating cellular lipids inhibits HIV fusion and how lipid biosynthesis can be modulated to potentially prevent HIV infection. We end this review by discussing the notion of targeting select host cell proteins for HIV therapy. We will review the role of the cellular proteins PDI, defensins and cytoskeletal proteins in facilitating the fusion reaction. As our understanding of the HIV fusion process increases, the identification of targets for developing entry inhibitors becomes more diverse. Given the rapid resistance of HIV to any selective pressure this is an important avenue in the advancement of drug therapy.

AB  - HIV fusion is mediated by the sequential interaction of the viral envelope glycoprotein with cellular receptors at the plasma membrane. We have previously reported that the upregulation of cellular ceramide levels following fenretinide treatment inhibits HIV fusion. As ceramide facilitates the internalization of a variety of microbes, we hypothesized that it may also promote the engulfment of HIV virions. Hence, we analyzed the effect of fenretinide treatment on virus binding and uptake. We observed that virus binding is not altered by fenretinide treatment. The distribution of HIV receptors was also unchanged. In contrast, virus uptake showed a significant increase. We have determined that fenretinide treatment promotes the internalization of virions from the plasma membrane and the accumulation of virus in the endocytic fraction of HeLa cells. This effect of fenretinide appears to be specific for virus as the endosomal accumulation of gp120, transferrin and horse-radish peroxidase was not increased. Notably, fenretinide increased the infectivity of influenza virus, which fuses in the endosomal compartment upon low pH activation. Our data suggest that fenretinide treatment effectively inhibits HIV infection by re-directing the virus to the endocytic pathway.

AB  - Previously, we reported that treatment of cells with sphingomyelinase inhibits human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) entry. Here, we determined by measuring fluorescence recovery after photobleaching that the lateral diffusion of CD4 decreased 4-fold following sphingomyelinase treatment, while the effective diffusion rate of CCR5 remained unchanged. Notably, sphingomyelinase treatment of cells did not influence gp120 binding, HIV-1 attachment, or fluid-phase and receptor-mediated endocytosis. Furthermore, sphingomyelinase treatment did not affect the membrane disposition of the HIV receptor proteins CD4, CXCR4, and CCR5, as determined by Triton X-100 extraction. Restriction of CD4 diffusion by antibody cross-linking also inhibited HIV infection. We therefore interpret the decrease in CD4 lateral mobility following sphingomyelinase treatment in terms of clustering of CD4 molecules. Examination of fusion intermediates indicated that sphingomyelinase treatment inhibited HIV at a step in the fusion process after CD4 engagement. Maximal inhibition of fusion was observed following short coculture times and with target cells that express low levels of CD4. As HIV entry into cells requires the sequential engagement of viral envelope protein with CD4 and coreceptor, we propose that sphingomyelinase inhibits HIV infection by inducing CD4 clustering that prevents coreceptor engagement and HIV fusion.

AB  - Studies of ceramide metabolism and function in a wide range of biological processes have revealed a role for this lipid in regulating key cellular responses. Our research on the role of sphingolipids in HIV entry has led to the hypothesis that modulation of ceramide levels in target cells affects their susceptibility to HIV infection by rearranging HIV receptors. Cellular ceramide levels were modulated by application of pharmacological agents such as N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide (4-HPR, fenretinide), by treatment with sphingomyelinase (Smase), or by exogenous addition of long-chain ceramide, and determined after metabolic incorporation of [3H]sphingosine. Infectivity assays were performed by using a HeLa-derived indicator cell line, TZM-bl, CD4+ lymphocytes, and monocytes. We observed a dose-dependent inhibition by 4-HPR of infection of TZM-bl cells by a broad range of HIV-1 isolates at low micromolar concentrations with an IC50 of <1 microM for most isolates tested. Nearly complete inhibition was seen at 5 microM, a dose that enhanced ceramide levels by 50-100%, yet was nontoxic to the cells. Treating cells with other pharmacological agents that enhanced ceramide levels, with Smase, or exogenous addition of long-chain ceramide also resulted in inhibition of HIV-1 infection. Enhancing ceramide levels in CD4+ lymphocytes and in monocyte-derived macrophages with 4-HPR or Smase significantly reduced infectivity without toxicity. The minimal toxicity of normal cells exposed to 4-HPR should make the drug exceedingly suitable as an anti-HIV therapeutic.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sex risks and drug use are related. This relation in youth is described. GOAL: To determine how stigmatized drug use is related to sexual risk behaviors and network characteristics among youth. STUDY DESIGN: In-person interviews were conducted with both a probability household sample (n = 363) and a targeted, street-recruited sample of cocaine, heroin, crack, or injected drug users (n - 165) comprising 18- to 24-year-olds in an inner city neighborhood. Drug use in the preceding 12 months was scaled hierarchically, lowest to highest social stigma, as none, marijuana, noninjected cocaine, noninjected heroin, crack, and injected drugs. RESULTS: Users of the more stigmatized drugs had more sex partners. They were more likely to report a history of concurrent sex partners, sex with someone who also had engaged in sex with a network member, commercial sex work, and unprotected sex. Findings showed crack use and drug injection to be associated more strongly with increased sex risk among women than among men. CONCLUSIONS: Young users of the more stigmatized drugs are at much greater network and behavior risk for sexually transmitted diseases. Drug use prevention, harm reduction interventions, or both may lower this risk.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine gender differences in drug injection equipment sharing at injecting initiation. METHODS: Young injecting drug users (IDUs) in New York City February 1999-2003 were surveyed about injection risk behaviors and circumstances at initiation. Analyses were gender-stratified and excluded participants who initiated alone. Multiple logistic regression estimated adjusted odds ratios. RESULTS: Participants (n=249) were 66% male and 82% White. Mean initiation age was 19.2; mean years since initiating was 3.0. Women were significantly more likely to cite social network influence as a reason for initiating, to have male and sex partner initiators, and to share injecting equipment than men. Among women, sharing any injection equipment was associated with initiation by a sex partner and having > or =2 people present. Among men, being injected by someone else predicted sharing any injection equipment, while using a legally obtained syringe was protective. CONCLUSIONS: Social persuasion stemming from sexual and/or social relationships with IDUs may increase women's risk of sharing injection equipment at initiation, and consequently, their early parenteral risk of acquiring blood-borne infections. Interventions should focus on likely initiates, especially women in injecting-discordant sex partnerships, and IDUs (potential initiators).

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected people's ability to buy, sell, and obtain items that they use in their daily lives. It may have had a particularly negative effect on the ability of people who use illicit opioids to obtain them because the networks they relied on are illicit and not part of the formal economy. Our objective in this research was to examine if, and how, disruptions related to COVID-19 of illicit opioid markets have affected people who use illicit opioids. METHOD: We collected 300 posts--including replies to posts--related to the intersection of COVID-19 and opioid use from Reddit.com, a forum that has several discussion threads (i.e., subreddits) dedicated to opioids. We then coded posts from the two most popular opioid subreddits during the early pandemic period (March 5, 2020-May 13, 2020) using an inductive/deductive approach. RESULTS: We found two themes related to active opioid use during the early pandemic: (a) changes in drug supply and difficulty obtaining opioids, and (b) buying less-trustworthy drugs from lesser-known sources. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that COVID-19 has created market conditions that place people who use opioids at risk of adverse outcomes, such as fatal overdose.

AB  - In adult rats, trans-resveratrol attenuates kainic acid (KA)-induced convulsions and the associated hippocampal neurotoxicity. Increased neuronal survival was correlated with reduced lipid peroxidation. Since free radical generation after KA is age dependent and does not correlate with the onset of seizure-induced injury, the present study investigated whether daily trans-resveratrol treatment in development could protect the juvenile hippocampus from seizures and onset of damage at postnatal (P) day 21. Rat pups were treated with daily injections of trans-resveratrol under three dosage regimens (1-15 mg/kg and 20-50mg/kg). Weight, electroencephalography (EEG), histology, and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor expression were determined. Malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration was assessed from separate animals. trans-Resveratrol did not interfere with growth or attenuate KA-induced EEG seizures. However, modest protection was afforded in the CA1, the subregion most sensitive to injury at this age. The CA3 and entorhinal amygdala cortex (AMG/EC) were not spared. Changes in NR1 subunit or NR1 C2 splice variant expression were also not prevented. Baseline MDA concentrations of hippocampal subfields were low at P14, P21, and P60 and high in aged adults. Glutamate (100 μM) to stimulate peroxidation products was significant at young ages but was much greater at older ages. After KA, elevated MDA levels were observed at 24h but only in adult preparations. Thus, while antioxidant therapy with trans-resveratrol may be considered as an adjunctive therapy to hinder epileptic activity and neurodegeneration at adult ages, it had only modest effects at young ages when production of free radicals within limbic structures is limited in this experimental model of seizures.

AB  - The current spread of democracy has not enabled the poor to use rights to win equity, raising questions about whether the poor and weak call use liberal democratic freedoms to address inequality. An oft-cited model of success, however, is the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC)'s campaign to press the South African government into distributing anti-retroviral medication to people living with HIV/AIDS. This article finds that TAC's strategy of using the rights and rules of constitutional democracy to win gains may offer all exemplar for forms of collective action which call win substantive equality, but that the model remains of limited application.

AB  - While attention has been paid to the study of panic disorder (PD) with or without agoraphobia among Caucasians, surprisingly little empirical research within the United States has looked at the phenomenology of PD among minority groups. In this paper we present data we have collected and review other research on the phenomenology, social supports, and coping behavior among African-Americans with panic disorder. Our studies indicate that, in comparison to Caucasians, African-Americans with PD reported more intense fears of dying or going crazy, as well as higher levels of numbing and tingling in their extremities. African-Americans reported higher rates of comorbid post traumatic disorder and more depression. African-Americans also used somewhat different coping strategies (such as religiosity and counting one's blessings), less self-blame, and were somewhat more dissatisfied with social supports. The incidence of isolated sleep paralysis was, as per previous reports, higher in African-Americans. These findings, results of other research, and the implications for assessment and treatment are discussed within a semantic network analysis of panic (Hinton and Hinton 2002, this issue).

AB  - Current guidelines recommend that, when prescribing opioids, providers use urine drug testing (UDT) for harm reduction. Objective: To identify whether Medicaid beneficiaries in Nevada at increased risk for opioid misuse received UDT. Methods: We used Nevada Medicaid claims data (2017-2018) to describe UDT among three samples: opioid naïve patients (N = 11,326), opioid naïve patients with a second follow-up prescription (N = 8,910), and long-term opioid patients (N = 19,173). Predictors of opioid misuse include past diagnoses of mental health and substance use, demographic characteristics and potentially risky behaviors. Outcomes include receiving UDT prior to opioid prescription among the two naïve samples and within six months for the long-term sample. We report predicted probabilities (PP) from logistic regressions and hazard ratios (HR) and Kaplan-Meier curves. Results: A small percentage of patients received UDT (naïve sample: 2.5%; naïve with a second follow-up prescription sample: 3.5%; long-term sample: 9.9%). Adults with alcohol disorders and other substance use disorders had the highest PP of UDT, among both the naïve (alcohol related disorder: 3.1%; other substance use disorder: 7.7%) and the naïve with a second follow-up prescription (alcohol related disorder: 4.1%; other substance use disorder: 11.7%) samples. Among the long-term sample, similar predictors were significant. Conclusions: Although there was an association between having risk factors for opioid misuse (e.g. past alchohol disorders and other substance use disorder diagnoses) and receiving UDT, the percentage of patients who received UDT was unexpectedly low, pointing to the need to increase guideline adherence and implementation among providers who prescribe opioids.

AB  - Some, but not all, "big events" such as wars, revolutions, socioeconomic transitions, economic collapses, and ecological disasters in recent years seem to lead to large-scale HIV outbreaks (Friedman et al, in press; Hankins et al 2002). This was true of transitions in the USSR, South Africa and Indonesia, for example, but not those in the Philippines or (so far) in Argentina. It has been hypothesized that whether or not HIV outbreaks occur is shaped in part by the nature and extent of changes in the numbers of voluntary or involuntary risk-takers, which itself may be related to the growth of roles such as sex-sellers or drug sellers; the riskiness of the behaviors engaged in by risk-takers; and changes in sexual and injection networks and other "mixing patterns" variables. Each of these potential causal processes, in turn, is shaped by the nature of pre-existing social networks and the patterns and content of normative regulation and communication that happen within these social networks-and on how these social networks and their characteristics are changed by the "big event" in question. We will present ideas about what research is needed to help understand these events and to help guide both indigenous community-based efforts to prevent HIV outbreaks and also to guide those who organize external intervention efforts and aid.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is often accompanied by liver fibrosis, which can progress to cirrhosis; C-C chemokine receptors type 2 and 5 (CCR2/CCR5), which mediate interactions driving inflammation and fibrosis, are promising treatment targets. Cenicriviroc (CVC), a dual-CCR2/CCR5 antagonist, has potent anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic activity in animal models; in HIV-positive subjects it reduced soluble CD14 levels, aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet count ratio index, and non-invasive hepatic fibrosis risk scores; favorable tolerability was demonstrated in ~600 subjects. Efficacy and safety of CVC 150 mg for treating NASH with liver fibrosis are being evaluated over 2 years (primary endpoint at Year 1 [Y1]). DESIGN: Phase 2b, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational study (CENTAUR; NCT02217475). Adults with histological evidence of NASH, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease activity score (NAS) ≥ 4, and liver fibrosis (stages 1-3 NASH clinical research network system) enrolled. Subjects have increased risk of progression to cirrhosis due to ≥1 characteristic: type 2 diabetes; body mass index > 25 kg/m(2) with ≥1 feature of metabolic syndrome; bridging fibrosis and/or NAS ≥ 5. Liver biopsy evaluation at Screening, Y1, and Year 2 (Y2). OBJECTIVES: Assess histologic improvement (≥2-point in NAS with ≥1-point improvement in >1 category) without worsening of fibrosis at Y1 (primary); evaluate complete NASH resolution without worsening of fibrosis at Y2 (key secondary). DISCUSSION: CENTAUR is the first prospective study evaluating an oral agent exclusively enrolling subjects with NASH and liver fibrosis, with increased risk of developing cirrhosis. It will compare shorter versus longer CVC treatment and assess correlations between decreased inflammation and fibrosis.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) has been previously shown to have cognition-enhancing effects. The role of neurotransmitter changes, measured by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, may inform the mechanisms for this response. OBJECTIVE: To examine the neurochemical effects of GHRH in a subset of participants from the parent trial. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled substudy of a larger trial. SETTING: Clinical research unit at the University of Washington School of Medicine. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty adults (17 with mild cognitive impairment [MCI]), ranging in age from 55 to 87 years, were enrolled and successfully completed the study. INTERVENTIONS: Participants self-administered daily subcutaneous injections of tesamorelin (Theratechnologies Inc), a stabilized analogue of human GHRH (1 mg/d), or placebo 30 minutes before bedtime for 20 weeks. At baseline and weeks 10 and 20, participants underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy protocols and cognitive testing and provided blood samples after fasting. Participants also underwent glucose tolerance tests before and after intervention. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Brain levels of glutamate, inhibitory transmitters γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG), and myo-inositol (MI), an osmolyte linked to Alzheimer disease in humans, were measured in three 2 × 2 × 2-cm3 left-sided brain regions (dorsolateral frontal, posterior cingulate, and posterior parietal). Glutamate, GABA, and MI levels were expressed as ratios to creatine plus phosphocreatine, and NAAG was expressed as a ratio to N-acetylaspartate. RESULTS: After 20 weeks of GHRH administration, GABA levels were increased in all brain regions (P < .04), NAAG levels were increased (P = .03) in the dorsolateral frontal cortex, and MI levels were decreased in the posterior cingulate (P = .002). These effects were similar in adults with MCI and older adults with normal cognitive function. No changes in the brain levels of glutamate were observed. In the posterior cingulate, treatment-related changes in serum insulin-like growth factor 1 were positively correlated with changes in GABA (r = 0.47; P = .001) and tended to be negatively correlated with MI (r = -0.34; P = .06). Consistent with the results of the parent trial, a favorable treatment effect on cognition was observed in substudy participants (P = .03). No significant associations were observed between treatment-related changes in neurochemical and cognitive outcomes. Glucose homeostasis in the periphery was not reliably affected by GHRH administration and did not account for treatment neurochemical effects. CONCLUSIONS: Twenty weeks of GHRH administration increased GABA levels in all 3 brain regions, increased NAAG levels in the frontal cortex, and decreased MI levels in the posterior cingulate. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that 20 weeks of somatotropic supplementation modulates inhibitory neurotransmitter and brain metabolite levels in a clinical trial, and it provides preliminary support for one possible mechanism to explain favorable GHRH effects on cognition in adults with MCI and in healthy older adults.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The aim of this review is to summarize the development of the photoactivated depot (PAD) approach for the minimally invasive and continuously variable delivery of insulin. RECENT FINDINGS: Using an insulin PAD, we have demonstrated that we can release native, bioactive insulin into diabetic animals in response to light signals from a small external LED light source. We have further shown that this released insulin retains bioactivity and reduces blood glucose. In addition, we have designed and constructed second generation materials that have high insulin densities, with the potential for multiple day delivery. The PAD approach for insulin therapy holds promise for addressing the pressing need for continuously variable delivery methods that do not rely on pumps, and their myriad associated problems.

AB  - Multidisciplinary Fatality Review teams have operated for decades in the United States and across the developed world. Goals of these teams include examining individual deaths in the community to determine preventability and to make recommendations for future prevention. Fatality Review teams initially focused on child deaths but have expanded to include deaths from domestic violence, elder abuse, overdose, and maternal mortality.Case reviews include data from various agencies that have had contact with victims and perpetrators prior to the deaths. Cause of death and preventability are analyzed. Preventable deaths often include those with risk from mental illness or addiction. Recommendations made by Fatality Review teams have led to important changes for mental health services and prevention, including the Safe Haven laws for neonaticide prevention, suicide and homicide prevention, child murder prevention, firearm laws, and domestic violence screening. Fatality Review teams, which already include law enforcement and forensic pathologists, can benefit from collaboration with forensic psychiatrists because of their specialized knowledge about the intersection of mental illness and violence, should forensic psychiatrists have an opportunity to join them.

AB  - Women in prison often have significant trauma histories, and PTSD is much more common among female inmates than in their community counterparts. Among female prisoners, PTSD is the second most common disorder, after substance use disorders. In this population, PTSD is often comorbid with substance use disorders, personality disorders, serious mental illnesses, and HIV. Pharmacotherapy options are limited in prisons, impacting treatment options. As well, psychotherapy usually must occur within group settings in prison, posing unique challenges in this population.

AB  - We have developed and applied a computational strategy to increase the affinity of fullerene-based inhibitors of the HIV protease. The result is a approximately 50-fold increase in affinity from previously tested fullerene compounds. The strategy is based on the design of derivatives which may potentially increase hydrophobic desolvation upon complex formation, followed by the docking of the hypothetical derivatives into the HIV protease active site and assessment of the model complexes so formed. The model complexes are generated by the program DOCK and then analyzed for desolvated hydrophobic surface. The amount of hydrophobic surface desolvated was compared with a previously tested compound, and if this amount was significantly greater, it was selected as a target. Using this approach, two targets were identified and synthesized, using two different synthetic approaches: a diphenyl C60 alcohol (5) based on a cyclopropyl derivative of Bingel (Chem.Ber. 1993, 126, 1957-1959) and a diisopropyl cyclohexyl C60 alcohol (4a) as synthesized by Ganapathi et al. (J. Org.Chem. 1995, 60, 2954-2955). Both showed tighter binding than the originally tested compound (diphenethylaminosuccinate methano-C60, Ki = 5 microM) with Ki values of 103 and 150 nM, respectively. In addition to demonstrating the utility of this approach, it shows that simple modification of fullerenes can result in high-affinity ligands of the HIV protease, for which they are highly complementary in structure and chemical nature.

Evaluation of our patients and the previously reported cases showed that perilesional linear atrophy or hypopigmentation (or both) is a distinct complication after intralesional or intraarticular administration of corticosteroids and is probably due to lymphogenous spread of the steroid suspension.

AB  - There is an increased frequency of Kaposi's sarcoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas in patients with AIDS. These "opportunistic malignancies" establish the diagnosis of AIDS in an HIV-positive patient and are associated with a high likelihood of gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary involvement. Kaposi's sarcoma is a multicentric cutaneous spindle-cell tumor that is associated with luminal lesions in at least 40 per cent of patients. Gastrointestinal KS is usually asymptomatic but may rarely bleed or obstruct. Treatment of KS with either radiation or chemotherapy can reduce tumor bulk, without affecting survival. Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas in AIDS are B-cell neoplasms composed of either noncleaved or blast cells, similar to those seen in Burkitt's lymphoma. The tumors are usually highly aggressive and present in extranodal sites in the majority of cases. Primary or secondary gastrointestinal involvement is frequent, with hepatic and rectal tumors being particularly common. Unlike KS, gastrointestinal lymphomas are usually symptomatic. Obstruction, perforation, and bleeding can occur in patients with luminal involvement. Jaundice due to hepatic infiltration or biliary obstruction may be seen. Treatment with chemotherapy is usually indicated because of the rapid progression of the tumor, although no prolongation of survival has been demonstrated. There may also be an increased incidence of Hodgkin's disease and anorectal neoplasia in patients with AIDS; however, these malignancies do not establish the diagnosis of AIDS in an HIV-positive patient.

AB  - KS and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas frequently involve the gut in patients with AIDS. These neoplasms establish the diagnosis of AIDS in an HIV-positive patient. KS is a spindle-cell tumour derived from lymphatic endothelia which is associated with luminal lesions in at least 40% of patients. Gastrointestinal KS is usually asymptomatic but may rarely bleed or obstruct. Treatment of KS with either interferon-alpha, radiation or chemotherapy can reduce tumour bulk, but does not alter overall survival in AIDS. Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas in AIDS are B cell neoplasms with many genotypic and phenotypic similarities to Burkitt's lymphoma. The tumours are usually highly aggressive, and present in extranodal sites in the majority of cases. Of these extranodal sites, gastrointestinal involvement is most common. Gastrointestinal lymphomas are usually symptomatic and almost always require treatment. Obstruction, perforation and bleeding may occur in patients with luminal involvement, whereas hepatic or biliary disease may lead to jaundice. Several chemotherapeutic regimens for lymphoma have been successfully used to achieve partial remission, although no prolongation of survival has been demonstrated. There appears to be an increased incidence of Hodgkin's disease in patients with AIDS, which is generally of advanced stage. This tumour does not meet the CDC criteria for AIDS as yet. Hepatic and/or splenic involvement in this setting are common.

AB  - Four patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and central retinal vein occlusion have been previously described in the literature. The pathologic findings in a fifth patient with this association are reported. The histopathologic findings were similar to ischemic central retinal vein occlusion in persons without HIV infections. There was no evidence of HIV in vascular endothelial cells using electron microscopy and in situ hybridization techniques. The failure to identify any structural or direct infectious cause for central retina vein occlusion in this setting suggests that other hemorheologic factors related to HIV infection are probably responsible for the predisposition to vascular thrombosis.

AB  - PURPOSE: To determine if topical gel is superior to subconjunctival injection of lidocaine in relieving pain of intravitreous injection of corticosteroid. DESIGN: Randomized clinical trial. PATIENT POPULATION: One hundred patients receiving intravitreous injection of triamcinolone. INTERVENTIONAL PROCEDURE: Topical lidocaine 2% gel and subconjunctival lidocaine 2% injection. OUTCOME MEASURE: Analog pain score assessment, conducted by technician masked to treatment. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in pain scores between the treatment groups (P = .1). CONCLUSIONS: The effective relief of pain with lidocaine for intravitreous injection is independent of its mode of application (gel vs subconjunctival injection).

AB  - Some long-term, large-scale socio-economic changes may affect the politics of HIV and other emerging viruses such as hepatitis C. It is useful to ask why the potential peace dividend of the early 1990s failed to provide adequate resources for HIV-related social and medical service delivery in developed or developing nations. This failure can be understood by looking at long-term global economic trends and the pressures they put on governments and corporations. They have produced a period in which fundamental issues of political and economic structure are at stake and, often, the response is a divide-and-rule politics to promote stability. National politics differ in terms of the extent to which such a 'politics of scapegoating' is institutionalized and in terms of which groups are scapegoated. Groups such as drug injectors, gay and bisexual men and sex traders are particularly likely to be targeted both by the scapegoaters and by HIV. Given this framework, how should public health professionals and activists engaged in HIV-related issues respond? Under what circumstances should we orient efforts upwards towards corporate, political or bureaucratic leaders? Under what circumstances, and how, should we orient towards popular forces? Relatedly, we need to consider an issue we often ignore: What do we have to offer potential allies? That is, in terms of their goals, philosophies and needs, why should they ally with us?

AB  - This paper presents a framework that may help explain the interactions among capitalism, infectious disease, and environmental change in the world and in the Mediterranean region. Capitalism and the longevity of national governments require continued investment and economic growth. This disrupts the environment, most urgently in terms of climate change, which is expected to single out the Mediterranean region for droughts and heat and to lead to mass migrations of people and animals. Capitalism also disrupts the habitats of fauna, and creates factory farming and markets for the sale of animals from local ecologies that are being "opened up" for profitable use-all of which leads to increased interaction between potential vectors of infectious diseases and humans. Capitalist globalization has encouraged widespread international and other travel of people and goods, which can carry infectious people or animal vectors across long distances very rapidly. In sum, capitalism requires development, which creates environmental and infectious disease crises. Solving this problem will require profound political and economic change. In the immediate term, public health and medical institutions need to be protected against the pressures of austerity.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe: (a) the prevalence and individual and network characteristics of group sex events (GSEs) and GSE attendees; and (b) HIV/sexually transmitted infection (STI) discordance among respondents who said they went to a GSE together. METHODS AND DESIGN: In a sociometric network study of risk partners (defined as sexual partners, persons with whom respondents attended a GSE, or drug injection partners) in Brooklyn, NY, we recruited a high-risk sample of 465 adults. Respondents reported on GSE attendance, the characteristics of GSEs, and their own and others' behaviors at GSEs. Sera and urines were collected, and STI prevalence was assayed. RESULTS: Of the 465 participants, 36% had attended a GSE in the last year, 26% had sex during the most recent of these GSEs, and 13% had unprotected sex there. Certain subgroups (hard drug users, men who have sex with men, women who have sex with women, and sex workers) were more likely to attend and more likely to engage in risk behaviors at these events. Among 90 GSE dyads, in which at least 1 partner named the other as someone with whom they attended a GSE in the previous 3 months, STI/HIV discordance was common [herpes simplex virus (HSV-2): 45% of dyads, HIV: 12% of dyads, and chlamydia: 21% of dyads]. Many GSEs had 10 or more participants, and multiple partnerships at GSEs were common. High attendance rates at GSEs among members of large networks may increase community vulnerability to STI/HIV, particularly because network data show that almost all members ofa large sociometric risk network either had sex with a GSE attendee or had sex with someone who had sex with a GSE attended. CONCLUSIONS: Self-reported GSE attendance and participation were common among this high-risk sample. STI/HIV discordance among GSE attendees was high, highlighting the potential transmission risk associated with GSEs. Research on sexual behaviors should incorporate measures of GSE behaviors as standard research protocol. Interventions should be developed to reduce transmission at GSEs.

AB  - Risk networks can transmit HIV or other infections; social networks can transmit social influence and thus help shape norms and behaviors. This primarily-theoretical paper starts with a review of network concepts, and then presents data from a New York network study to study patterns of sexual and injection linkages among IDUs and other drug users and nonusers, men who have sex with men, women who have sex with women, other men and other women in a high-risk community and the distribution of HIV, sex at group sex events, and health intravention behaviors in this network. It then discusses how risk network microstructures might influence HIV epidemics and urban vulnerability to epidemics; what social and other forces (such as "Big Events" like wars or ecological disasters) might shape networks and their associated norms, intraventions, practices and behaviors; and how network theory and research have and may continue to contribute to developing interventions against HIV epidemics.

AB  - Objectives: To determine infection patterns of sexually transmitted infections that facilitate HIV transmission among HIV-discordant couples. Methods: 112 initial respondents were recruited in an impoverished neighbourhood of Brooklyn, New York. Their sexual (and injection) partners were recruited in up to four additional network sampling waves for a final sample of 465 persons aged 18 years or older. After separate informed consent had been obtained, blood and urine were collected and tested for HIV, type-specific antibodies to herpes simplex virus (HSV-2), syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhoea. Results: Of 30 HIV-discordant partnerships, five were same-sex male partnerships and 25 were opposite-sex partnerships. No subjects tested positive for syphilis or gonorrhoea. Two couples were chlamydia-discordant. For HSV-2, 16 couples were double-positive, eight discordant, four double-negative, and two comprised a HSV-2-negative with a partner with missing herpes data. Conclusions: HSV-2 was present in 83% of the HIV-discordant couples, chlamydia in 7%, and syphilis and gonorrhoea in none. HSV-2 is probably more important for HIV transmission than bacterial sexually transmitted diseases because it is more widespread. Even given the limited generalisability of this community-based sample, there seems to be an important HIV-prevention role for herpes detection and prevention activities in places where HIV-infected people are likely to be encountered, including sexually transmitted disease clinics, HIV counselling and testing programmes, prisons, needle exchanges, and drug abuse treatment programmes. The effects of HSV-suppressive therapy in highly impacted groups should also be investigated.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To measure differences and similarities in the prevalence of HIV infection and of related risk and protective behaviors among New York City black, white, and Hispanic drug injectors during a period of decreasing HIV prevalence. METHODS: Drug injectors were interviewed at a drug detoxification clinic and a research storefront in New York City from 1990 to 1996. All subjects had injected drugs within the last six months. Phlebotomy for HIV testing was conducted after pretest counseling. Analysis compares the first half (period) of this recruitment interval with the second half. RESULTS: HIV seroprevalence declined among each racial/ethnic group. In each period, white drug injectors were significantly less likely to be infected than either blacks or Hispanics. Similar declines were found in separate analyses by gender, length of time since first injection, and by recruitment site. After adjustment for changes in sample composition over time, blacks and Hispanics remained significantly more likely to be infected than whites. Interactions indicate that the decline may be greatest among Hispanics and slowest among blacks. A wide variety of risk behaviors declined in each racial/ethnic group; and syringe exchange use increased in each group. Few respondents reported injecting with members of a different racial group at their last injection event. CONCLUSIONS: HIV prevalence and risk behaviors seem to be falling among each racial/ethnic group of drug injectors. Black and Hispanic injectors continue to be more likely to be infected. Declining prevalence among whites poses some risk of politically based decisions to reduce prevention efforts. Overall, these results show that risk reduction can be successful among all racial/ethnic groups of drug injectors and suggest that continued risk reduction programs may be able to attain further declines in infection rates in each group.

AB  - HIV continues to be transmitted at unacceptably high rates among African Americans, and most HIV-prevention interventions have focused on behavioral change. To theorize additional approaches to HIV prevention among African Americans, we discuss how sexual networks and drug-injection networks are as important as behavior for HIV transmission. We also describe how higher-order social structures and processes, such as residential racial segregation and racialized policing, may help shape risk networks and behaviors. We then discuss 3 themes in African American culture-survival, propriety, and struggle-that also help shape networks and behaviors. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of how these perspectives might help reduce HIV transmission among African Americans.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To understand associations of punitive policies to the population prevalence of injection drug users and to HIV seroprevalence among injectors. DESIGN AND METHODS: A lagged-cross-sectional analysis of metropolitan statistical area data. Estimates of drug injectors per capita and of HIV seroprevalence among injectors in 89 large US metropolitan areas were regressed on three measures of legal repressiveness (hard drug arrests per capita; police employees per capita; and corrections expenditures per capita) controlling for other metropolitan area characteristics. RESULTS: No legal repressiveness measures were associated with injectors per capita; all three measures of legal repressiveness were positively associated with HIV prevalence among injectors. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that legal repressiveness may have little deterrent effect on drug injection and may have a high cost in terms of HIV and perhaps other diseases among injectors and their partners--and that alternative methods of maintaining social order should be investigated.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To determine the extent to which youth who reside in households in a neighborhood with large numbers of drug injectors 1) are infected with parenterally or sexually transmitted agents, and 2) engage in high-risk behaviors. STUDY DESIGN: A multistage probability household sample survey was conducted in Bushwick, Brooklyn from 1994 to 1995. All households in 12 randomly selected primary sampling units were screened for age-eligible youth. One hundred eleven English-speaking 18- to 21-year-olds were interviewed. One hundred three sera were tested for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), Hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus (HCV), human T-cell lymphotrophic virus types I and II (HTLV-I/II), herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), or syphilis. Urines were tested for chlamydial infection, and for opiate and cocaine metabolites. RESULTS: Eighty-nine percent had sex in the past year, 45% with two or more partners. Only 19% of the sexually active always used condoms. Two (of 95) had had sex with a crack smoker. Thirty percent of women reported being coerced the first time they had sex, and 23% of women and 3% of men reported having been sexually abused. Only 3% reported ever using heroin, and 9% cocaine. Only one reported ever having injected drugs or smoked crack. Some underreporting of stigmatized behaviors occurred: two "nonreporters" had opiate-positive urines and two had cocaine-positive urines. Marijuana use was common, with 48% using it in the past year. No subjects tested positive for HIV-1, HIV-II, or syphilis; 2% tested positive for HTLV-I and 3% for hepatitis C; 3% had hepatitis B markers, 12% had chlamydial infection, and 50% serologic HSV-2 markers. CONCLUSIONS: Population-representative samples of high-risk communities can provide important knowledge. Although heroin and cocaine use, during drug injection, and rates of infection with parenterally transmitted infectious agents appear to be lower among these youth, sexual risk behaviors and chlamydial and HSV-2 infection are widespread. Sexually transmitted disease screening and outreach strategies are needed both to prevent sexually transmitted disease sequelae (including potential increased susceptibility to HIV infection) and to prevent transmission to partners.

AB  - This paper discusses the user side of harm reduction, focusing to some extent on the early responses to the HIV/AIDS epidemic in each of four sets of localities-New York City, Rotterdam, Buenos Aires, and sites in Central Asia. Using available qualitative and quantitative information, we present a series of vignettes about user activities in four different localities in behalf of reducing drug-related harm. Some of these activities have been micro-social (small group) activities; others have been conducted by formal organizations of users that the users organized at their own initiative. In spite of the limitations of the methodology, the data suggest that users' activities have helped limit HIV spread. These activities are shaped by broader social contexts, such as the extent to which drug scenes are integrated with broader social networks and the way the political and economic systems impinge on drug users' lives. Drug users are active agents in their own individual and collective behalf, and in helping to protect wider communities. Harm reduction activities and research should take note of and draw upon both the micro-social and formal organizations of users. Finally, both researchers and policy makers should help develop ways to enable and support both micro-social and formally organized action by users.

AB  - Intravenous (IV) drug users are the second largest risk group for AIDS and the main source of infection for heterosexual partner and pediatric AIDS cases. IV drug users have an addiction and a subculture that make risk reduction difficult; for example, to refuse to share needles can endanger personal relationships, and carrying clean works (rather than renting them in a shooting gallery) risks arrest. In New York City, at least, knowledge about AIDS transmission is widespread among IV drug users, and most drug injectors report having changed their drug use practices to reduce their risks. The main functions of health education in areas where IV drug users have this level of knowledge are to disseminate news of new discoveries; reach those drug users who have not yet learned AIDS basics; reinforce what is already known; and provide information about new programs to help drug users deal with AIDS-related problems. To encourage behavior change requires going beyond simple education, however; it entails trying to change IV drug user subculture. Drug user groups in the Netherlands and in New York City are attempting to do this from within the subculture. Outside intervention requires repeated messages from multiple sources; face-to-face, interactive communication; and perhaps the use of ex-addicts as health educators.

AB  - Gays and intravenous (i.v.) drug users are the two largest risk groups for AIDS. Gays, unlike drug users, have formed many organizations to deal with AIDS. Data are presented indicating that gay individuals have more risk-reducing behavioral changes than have i.v. drug users. It is also shown that i.v. drug users are more likely to protect themselves if their acquaintances do so. It is suggested that collective self-organization can lead to peer support for risk reduction and that this can help i.v. drug users to reduce their risks on an ongoing basis. Difficulties that face i.v. drug users' attempts to organize collectively and examples of i.v. drug user collective organization to deal with AIDS and other problems are discussed.

AB  - Gauging the impact of AIDS on intravenous drug users requires analysis of the cultural, political, and racial contexts of American society in which drug use is embedded. Considerable variation in behavior among drug injectors and noninjectors in different cities over time further complicates an understanding of the dynamics of drug use. AIDS has prompted many IV drug users to change their behavior, though not all users have reduced the risks of transmitting HIV infection. While expanded harm-reduction strategies and drug abuse treatment systems may help limit the epidemic's spread, weak federal support, constrained hospital resources, and racial stigma inhibit more direct action needed to stem the negative social and personal consequences of drug use.

AB  - Current ideas about HIV prevention include a mixture of primarily biomedical interventions, socio-mechanical interventions such as sterile syringe and condom distribution, and behavioral interventions. This article presents a framework for socially-integrated transdisciplinary HIV prevention that may improve current prevention efforts. It first describes one socially-integrated transdisciplinary intervention project, the Transmission Reduction Intervention Project. We focus on how social aspects of the intervention integrate its component parts across disciplines and processes at different levels of analysis. We then present socially-integrated perspectives about how to improve combination antiretroviral treatment (cART) processes at the population level in order to solve the problems of the treatment cascade and make "treatment as prevention" more effective. Finally, we discuss some remaining problems and issues in such a social transdisciplinary intervention in the hope that other researchers and public health agents will develop additional socially-integrated interventions for HIV and other diseases.

AB  - This study was set up to determine the predictors of condom use in the heterosexual non-commercial sexual relationships of young adults who neither inject drugs nor use cocaine, heroin or crack, in a neighbourhood with widespread drug-use-connected HIV. The analytic sample is 279 young adults, aged 18-24, who have never injected drugs and who have not used heroin, cocaine or crack in the last year. They were recruited in the Bushwick neighbourhood of New York City, July 1997 to September 1999. A face-to-face interview included items about their sociodemographic background, substance use and sexual networks. Sexual relationship and self-reported consistent (100%) condom use over the prior year with the partner in a given relationship was examined. Subjects had 337 heterosexual non-commercial relationships. Consistent condom use was reported in 32% of these relationships. In multiple logistic regression, consistent condom use was more likely in relationships that are not 'very close' (odds ratio = 3.92; 95% confidence interval = 2.08, 7.52); in the relationships of subjects whose peer norms support condom use (OR = 1.94; 95% CI = 1.43, 2.69), who are not problem drinkers (OR = 8.70; 95% CI = 2.22, 58.8), and (perhaps as a result of measurement issues) who are men (OR = 1.95; 95% CI = 1.04, 3.68). In conclusion, consistent condom use remains uncommon among youth in this high-risk neighbourhood. It is thus important to keep HIV from entering the sexual networks of youth in communities like this through programmes aimed at drug injectors and their sexual partners. Programmes to increase condom use among young adults should focus on strengthening norms that promote safer sex to protect oneself and others. In addition, assistance should be provided to youth who are problem drinkers.

AB  - In a population-representative sample of 202 18-24-year-old women in a neighborhood with widespread injection of drugs and HIV, 14% reported unprotected anal sex with men in the past year. Independent significant predictors were illegal drug use, having a main partner who takes the lead in deciding what to do during sex, and less self-deception. Having ever had anal sex was associated with having ever been infected with hepatitis B.

AB  - The objectives of this study were to determine predictors of consistent condom use in heterosexual relationships of young adults who use hard drugs in a neighbourhood with widespread drug-use-connected HIV. We interviewed 196 18-24 year olds who injected drugs or used heroin, cocaine or crack in the prior year and lived in the Bushwick neighbourhood of New York City. Interviews covered sociodemographics, substance use and sexual networks. The unit of analysis is the relationship; the dependent variable measures consistent condom use over the prior 30 days in a given relationship. Consistent condom use was reported in 26% of 377 non-commercial relationships and in all of 22 commercial relationships. Using multiple logistic regression, consistent condom use in non-commercial relationships was more likely in relationships that are not 'very close'; for men (but not women) with peers whose norms are more favourable to condom use; and for subjects who had concurrent sex partners in the last 12 months. In conclusion, we found that: (1) the lack of relationship between the peer norms of drug-using women and their condom use suggests they may have little control over condom use in their relationships-programmes should attempt to empower young women drug users and to develop ways for their peers to influence the men in their lives; (2) epidemiologically, the positive association of concurrency to consistent condom use suggests that condom use may be restricting HIV spread through the community-the presence of consistent condom use in all of the commercial sexual relationships also may restrict HIV spread; (3) prevention efforts should attempt to change peer cultures as a way to develop self-sustaining risk reduction. These changes should include changes in gender roles and power relations.

AB  - AIMS: To determine relationships between drug use "hardness" (defined in increasing order of hardness as no drug use, marijuana use, non-injected heroin or cocaine use, crack smoking and injection drug use) and prevalences of several sexually transmissible infections among young adults in a high-risk neighbourhood. Drug users, particularly injection drug users and crack smokers, may be a core group for some sexually transmitted infections. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey and assays of young adults from (a) a household probability sample and (b) a targeted sample of youth who have used injected drugs, crack, other cocaine or heroin. SETTING: Bushwick, an impoverished New York City minority neighbourhood with major drug markets. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 363 18-24-year-olds from a household probability sample; 165 Bushwick 18-24-year-olds who have used injected drugs, crack, other cocaine or heroin. MEASUREMENTS: Drug use by self-report; serum- and urine-based assays for HIV, hepatitis B and C, syphilis, gonorrhoea, chlamydia and herpes simplex (type 2). FINDINGS: Household-sample prevalences: HIV, hepatitis C and syphilis, 1%; gonorrhoea 3%; chlamydia 5%; past or present hepatitis B infection 8%; herpes simplex (type 2) 18%. In combined household and targeted samples, hepatitis C and HIV were concentrated among drug injectors. Herpes simplex (type 2), syphilis and hepatitis B increased among women with "hardest drug ever used". CONCLUSIONS: Using "harder" drugs is associated with some but not all of these infections. Prevention efforts should help youth avoid unsafe sex and higher-risk drugs.

AB  - AIMS: Drug scenes (social and spatial drug-using and drug-selling environments) have complex role structures. Many drug injectors earn money or drugs as drug or syringe sellers, hit doctors (people who help others to inject) commercial sex workers, or in other roles. This paper aims to measure "role behaviors" of drug injectors; describe which drug injectors are more likely to engage in such role behaviors; and to determine whether roles are related to elements of HIV risk. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study of drug injectors. SETTING: Bushwick, a section of Brooklyn, New York, a major location for injection drug use and drug sales. PARTICIPANTS: Seven hundred and sixty-seven street-recruited drug injectors. MEASUREMENTS: Participants were interviewed about their roles, behaviors, socio-demographics and risk networks; sera were collected and assayed for HIV and hepatitis B core antibody. FINDINGS: Socio-demographic variables are related to role-holding in complex ways. Economic need is generally associated with engaging in drug-scene role behaviors. Holders of these roles are at greater behavioral and network risk for HIV and other blood-borne infections than are other drug injectors. They also engage in extensive communication with other drug users, including discussion of HIV risk reduction. CONCLUSION: Role behaviors can be measured in quantitative studies, and seem to be related to HIV risk. Role-holders may be strategic targets for risk-reduction campaigns. It seems feasible and advisable to measure drug scene role-holding in research on drug users.

AB  - Zoonotic epidemics and pandemics have become frequent. From HIV/AIDS through COVID-19, they demonstrate that pandemics are social processes as well as health occurrences. The roots of these pandemics lie in changes in the socioeconomic interface between humanity and non-human host species that facilitate interspecies transmission. The degree to which zoonoses spread has been increased by the greater speed and extent of modern transportation and trade. Pre-existing sociopolitical and economic structures and conflicts in societies also affect pathogen propagation. As an epidemic develops, it can itself become a social and political factor, and change and interact with pre-existing sociobehavioral norms and institutional structures. This paper uses a "Big Events" approach to frame these processes. Based on this framework, we discuss how social readiness surveys implemented both before and during an outbreak might help public health predict how overall systems might react to an epidemic and/or to disease control measures, and thus might inform interventions to mitigate potential adverse outcomes or possibly preventing outbreaks from developing into epidemics. We conclude by considering what "pathways measures", in addition to those we and others have already developed, might usefully be developed and validated to assist outbreak and epidemic disease responses.

AB  - From 1988 to 1991, 6,882 drug injectors in 15 US cities were interviewed and had serum samples collected. The interviews and samples were analyzed for determination of significant predictors of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seroconversion in the 10 low seroprevalence cities and the five high seroprevalence cities. The unit of analysis was the period of observation between consecutive paired interviews/blood samples. In Cox proportional hazards regression, significant predictors of seroconversion in the low seroprevalence cities were: not being in drug treatment, injecting in outdoor settings or abandoned buildings, using crack cocaine weekly or more frequently, engaging in woman-to-woman sex, being of non-Latino race/ethnicity, and city seroprevalence. Predictors in high seroprevalence cities were: injecting with potentially infected syringes, not being in drug treatment, and having a sex partner who injected drugs. These findings suggest that HIV may be concentrated in sociobehavioral pockets of infection in low seroprevalence cities. For reducing HIV transmission, these results suggest: 1) in low seroprevalence cities, localized monitoring to detect specific emerging sociobehavioral pockets of infection, and quick implementation of appropriate targeted interventions if necessary; 2) in high seroprevalence cities, relatively more emphasis on locality-wide outreach and syringe-exchange projects to reduce risky behavior; and 3) in both types of cities, considerable expansion of drug treatment programs.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To study how condom use in injecting drug users' (IDU) relationships differs according to whether they are HIV-infected, and to whether their sex partner is an IDU. DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 317 street-recruited IDU were HIV-antibody tested and interviewed about 421 relationships with particular sex partners. RESULTS: Condoms were consistently (100%) used in sex between partners (during the previous 30 days) in 33% of these relationships, and their use was significantly more frequent in relationships of seropositive IDU and in relationships with non-IDU partners. In relationships between seropositive IDU and non-IDU, consistent condom use was reported to be high (68%); this remained unchanged under multivariate controls. CONCLUSIONS: Self-reported condom use by IDU in New York, with its relatively mature epidemic, appears to be concentrated where it may most reduce the spread of HIV to non-IDU heterosexuals, i.e., in relationships between infected IDU and non-IDU partners. Differential condom use by serostatus and by partners' drug injection should be incorporated into mathematical models of the HIV epidemic. Causes of the high level of condom use in this subset of relationships may include drug injector altruism and pressure by sex partners; prevention programs should develop ways to use both of these factors to motivate increased condom use.

AB  - This article describes and compares distributions of drug-scene roles, frequency of engaging in role behaviors, and relationships of role-holding to high-risk behaviors and sexual partnerships among Puerto Rican injection drug users in New York and Puerto Rico. For this study 561 street-recruited injection drug users in East Harlem, New York, and 312 in Bayamón, Puerto Rico were asked the number of days (in the last 30) in which they earned money or drugs in each of seven drug-scene roles; and about behaviors and egocentric risk partner characteristics in the last 30 days. East Harlem subjects were more likely to get resources by selling drugs and syringes, and buying drugs for someone else; Bayamón subjects were more likely to be "hit doctors," buy needles for others, operate a shooting gallery, or escort others to shooting galleries. All roles were part-time except shooting gallery management in East Harlem. About 27% of respondents at each site engaged in two or more roles. Many roles were associated with increased odds of injecting more than twice a day, receptive syringe sharing, distributive syringe sharing, receptive paraphernalia sharing, and having a drug-injecting sex partner. Drug-scene role structures vary between cities. Most roles are part-time pursuits. Role-holders have higher-risk behaviors and sexual partnerships than other drug injectors. Although further research is needed, drug-scene role-holders should be targeted for interventions to affect their own risk and their communications with others.

AB  - In many cities, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 seroprevalence among drug injectors stabilizes at 30-70% for many years without secondary outbreaks that increase seroprevalence by 15% or more. The authors considered how HIV-1 incidence can remain moderate at seroprevalence levels that would give maximum incidence. Previously suggested answers include behavioral risk reduction and network saturation within high-risk subgroups. Among 767 drug injectors studied in 1991-1993, during a period of stable high seroprevalence in New York City, risk behaviors remained common, and networks were far from saturated. The authors suggest a different network-based mechanism: in stable high-prevalence situations, the relatively small sizes of subnetworks of linked seronegatives (within larger networks containing both infected and uninfected persons) may limit infectious outbreaks. Any primary infection outbreak would probably be limited to members of connected subcomponents of seronegatives, and the largest such subcomponent in the study contained only 18 members (of 415 seronegatives). Research and mathematical modeling should study conditions that may affect the size and stability of subcomponents of seronegatives. Finally, if the existence of small, connected components of seronegatives prevents secondary outbreaks, this protection may weaken, and vulnerability to new outbreaks increase, if HIV-1 seroprevalence falls. Thus, in situations of declining prevalence, prevention programs should be maintained or strengthened.

AB  - The opioid/overdose crisis in the United States and Canada has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives and has become a major field for research and interventions. It has embroiled pharmaceutical companies in lawsuits and possible bankruptcy filings. Effective interventions and policies toward this and future drug-related outbreaks may be improved by understanding the sociostructural roots of this outbreak. Much of the literature on roots of the opioid/overdose outbreak focuses on (1) the actions of pharmaceutical companies in inappropriately promoting the use of prescription opioids; (2) "deaths of despair" based on the deindustrialization of much of rural and urban Canada and the United States, and on the related marginalization and demoralization of those facing lifetimes of joblessness or precarious employment in poorly paid, often dangerous work; and (3) increase in occupationally-induced pain and injuries in the population. All three of these roots of the crisis-pharmaceutical misconduct and unethical marketing practices, despair based on deindustrialization and increased occupational pain-can be traced back, in part, to what has been called the "one-sided class war" that became prominent in the 1970s, became institutionalized as neo-liberalism in and since the 1980s, and may now be beginning to be challenged. We describe this one-sided class war, and how processes it sparked enabled pharmaceutical corporations in their misconduct, nurtured individualistic ideologies that fed into despair and drug use, weakened institutions that created social support in communities, and reduced barriers against injuries and other occupational pain at workplaces by reducing unionization, weakening surviving unions, and weakening the enforcement of rules about workplace safety and health. We then briefly discuss the implications of this analysis for programs and policies to mitigate or reverse the opioid/overdose outbreak.

AB  - This article estimates HIV prevalence rates among injection drug users (IDUs) in 95 large US metropolitan areas to facilitate social and policy analyses of HIV epidemics. HIV prevalence rates among IDUs in these metropolitan areas were calculated by taking the mean of two estimates: (1) estimates based on regression adjustments to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Voluntary HIV Counseling and Testing data and (2) estimates based on the ratio of the number of injectors living with HIV to the number of injectors living in the metropolitan area. The validity of the resulting estimates was assessed. HIV prevalence rates varied from 2 to 28% (median 5.9%; interquartile range 4.0-10.2%). These HIV prevalence rates correlated with similar estimates calculated for 1992 and with two theoretically related phenomena: laws against over-the-counter purchase of syringes and income inequality. Despite limitations in the accuracy of these estimates, they can be used for structural analyses of the correlates, predictors and consequences of HIV prevalence rates among drug injectors in metropolitan areas and for assessing and targeting the service needs for drug injectors.

AB  - The papers in this volume cover a wide range of important topics. Yet many other equally important topics are not addressed. These include: (1) emerging trends in the epidemiology of HIV and drug use, such as the evidence that crack use may lead many of its practitioners to engage in high risk sex; (2) ways to deliver HIV prophylaxis to infected drug injectors, sexual partners, or perinatally infected children; and (3) the effectiveness of standard outreach in encouraging risk reduction. They do, however, provide important information about how to deal with both cocaine use and AIDS. They also raise many fruitful issues for additional research.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Education innovations by health professions faculty are shaped by faculty conceptualizations of the pathway between their innovations and changes in health of communities. AIMS: We aimed to explore how existing theories about the relationship between education and health are attended to, interpreted, and applied by faculty in different national contexts. METHODS: We compared existing theoretical frameworks to perceptions of "front line" faculty. Fellows in Brazil- and India-based FAIMER faculty development programs were asked via questionnaires about the contribution of their education innovation projects to health improvements. RESULTS: Faculty identified pathways to improved societal health via increased quality, and to a lesser extent relevance, of education. Relationships between increased quantity of education and improved health were focused on faculty development. Faculty from both countries noted the value for health outcomes of innovations that affect networks and partnerships with other institutions. Faculty from India identified pathways to improved societal health via changes to instructional more than institutional processes. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate where there are gaps in existing theories, a need to raise awareness about potential pathways to improving health via education changes, and opportunities for more detailed understanding of mechanisms of change via in-depth research.

AB  - "Intravention," prevention activities that are conducted by and sustained through ongoing actions of members of communities-at-risk, is an appropriate goal for HIV intervention activities. Data from 120 injection drug users in a Brooklyn, New York, neighborhood that has seen decreases in HIV prevalence among IDUs and little HIV diffusion to young adults indicate that most of them have recently (3 months) urged other people to engage in one or more self-protective actions. These data suggest that the common image of IDUs as simply being sources of social and medical problems is inaccurate. Research is needed into how to create and diffuse "communities of intravention; " and we suggest that behavioral interventions be evaluated for their success or failure at creating outward-focused health communication by participants as well as for their impact on individual risk behaviors.

AB  - "Social capital" has been critiqued as distracting attention from inequalities and policies that produce ill health. We support this critique insofar as social capital refers to the degree of trust and consensus in a locality, but find value in another dimension often included in the concept of social capital--social network ties and their associated communication patterns. We present a case study of Bushwick, a community of 100,000 people in Brooklyn NY, to suggest that the network aspect of "social capital" is useful to understand the active, on-the-ground processes by which residents of some neighborhoods beset by poverty, racial/ethnic subordination, and internal divisions (that themselves arise from inequalities and state policies) work out ways to defend their own and others' safety and health. We use a combination of population-representative survey data for young adults; sexual network survey data; and ethnography to show that Bushwick residents (including drug users and dealers) have used social network ties, communication, and normative pressures to reduce the extent to which they are put at risk by the drug trade and by drug-use-related HIV/AIDS in spite of conflicting interests, disparate values, and widespread distrust both of other community members and of dominant social institutions. This was done by "intravention" health communications, development of protective norms, informal negotiations, and other forms of adjustments within and among various groups--but it occurred in the absence of trust or consensus in this community. We conclude both (1) that social network interpretations of "social capital" might be better conceptualized in dialectic terms as collective action to survive in a harsh social order, and (2) that the social capital theory emphasis on trust and consensus as important causal factors for lowering drug-related risks at the community level may be a romanticized and erroneous perspective.

AB  - Big Events are periods during which abnormal large-scale events like war, economic collapse, revolts, or pandemics disrupt daily life and expectations about the future. They can lead to rapid change in health-related norms, beliefs, social networks and behavioural practices. The world is undergoing such Big Events through the interaction of COVID-19, a large economic downturn, massive social unrest in many countries, and ever-worsening effects of global climate change. Previous research, mainly on HIV/AIDS, suggests that the health effects of Big Events can be profound, but are contingent: Sometimes Big Events led to enormous outbreaks of HIV and associated diseases and conditions such as injection drug use, sex trading, and tuberculosis, but in other circumstances, Big Events did not do so. This paper discusses and presents hypotheses about pathways through which the current Big Events might lead to better or worse short and long term outcomes for various health conditions and diseases; considers how pre-existing societal conditions and changing 'pathway' variables can influence the impact of Big Events; discusses how to measure these pathways; and suggests ways in which research and surveillance might be conducted to improve human capacity to prevent or mitigate the effects of Big Events on human health.

AB  - Nonmedical prescription opioid use has become widespread. It can lead to heroin use, drug injection and HIV infection. We describe young adult opioid users' sexual risk behavior, partnerships and settings. 464 youth aged 18-29 who reported opioid use in the past 30 days were recruited using Respondent-Driven Sampling. Eligible participants completed a computer-assisted, interviewer-administered risk questionnaire and were tested for STIs and HIV. Participants (33% female; 66% white non-Hispanic) almost all had sex in the prior 90 days; 42% reported more than one partner. Same-sex sex was reported by 3% of men and 10% of women. Consistent condom use was rare. Seven percent reported group sex participation in the last 90 days but lifetime group sex was common among men and women. Young opioid users' unprotected sex, multiple partners and group sex puts them and others at high HIV and STI risk.

AB  - This article discusses relevant literature on group sex events--defined as events at which some people have sex with more than one partner--as risk environments, with a particular focus on group sex events where people who take drugs by non-injection routes of administration participate and where the event is not primarily LGBT-identified, at a "classic" crack house, nor in a brothel. It also briefly presents some findings from a small ethnography of such events. Group sex participation by people who take drugs by non-injection routes of administration seems to be widespread. It involves both behavioural and network risk for HIV and STI infection, including documented high-risk behaviour and sexual mixing of STI- and HIV-infected people with those who are uninfected. Indeed several HIV and STI outbreaks have been documented as based on such group sex events. Further, group sex events often serve as potential bridge environments that may allow infections to pass from members of one high-risk-behavioural category to another, and to branch out through these people's sexual and/or injection networks to other members of the local community. The ethnographic data presented here suggest a serious possibility of "third party transmission" of infectious agents between people who do not have sex with each other. This can occur even when condoms are consistently used since condoms and sex toys are sometimes used with different people without being removed or cleaned, and since fingers and mouths come into contact with mucosal surfaces of other members of the same or opposite sex. In addition to being risk environments, many of these group sex events are venues where risk-reducing norms, activities and roles are present--which lays the basis for harm reduction interventions. Research in more geographical locations is needed so we can better understand risks associated with group sex events in which drug users participate--and, in particular, how both participants and others can intervene effectively to reduce the risks posed to participants and non-participants by these group sex events. Such interventions are needed and should be developed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Prevalence rates for long-term injection drug users in some localities surpass 60% for HIV and 80% for HCV. We describe methods for developing grounded hypotheses about how some injectors avoid infection with either virus. SUBJECTS: 25 drug injectors who have injected drugs 8 - 15 years in New York City. 17 remain without antibody to either HIV or HCV; 3 are double-positives; and 5 are positive for HCV but not HIV. "Staying Safe" methodology compares serostatus groups using detailed biographical timelines and narratives; and information about how subjects maintain access to physical resources and social support; their strategies and tactics to remain safe; how they handle problems of addiction and demands by drug dealers and other drug users; and how their behaviors and strategies do or do not become socially-embedded practices. Grounded theory and life-history analysis techniques compare and contrast doubly-uninfected with those infected with both viruses or only with HCV. RESULTS: Themes and initial hypotheses emerging from analyses included two master hypotheses that, if confirmed, should help shape preventive interventions: 1) Staying uninfected is not simply a question of social structure or social position. It involves agency by drug injectors, including sustained hard work and adaptation to changing circumstances. 2) Multiple intentionalities contribute to remaining uninfected. These conscious goals include balancing one's need for drugs and one's income; developing ways to avoid drug withdrawal sickness; avoiding situations where other drug users importune you to share drugs; and avoiding HIV (and perhaps HCV) infection. Thus, focusing on a single goal in prevention might be sub-optimal. Other hypotheses specify mechanisms of enacting these intentionalities. One example is finding ways to avoid extreme social ostracism. CONCLUSION: We have identified strategies and tactics that some doubly-uninfected IDUs have developed to stay safe. Staying Safe methodology develops grounded hypotheses. These can be tested through cohort studies of incidence and prevention trials of hypothesis-based programs to help drug injectors make their injection and sexual careers safer for themselves and others. This positive deviance control-case life history method might be used to study avoiding other infections like genital herpes among sex workers.

AB  - Many drug injectors continue to engage in behaviors that lead them to become infected with HIV in spite of a wide variety of public health programs. In addition, many persons have begun to inject drugs in spite of knowing the risks of AIDS. The inadequacy of current efforts to prevent these behaviors suggests that additional forms of intervention should be attempted. We suggest that social interventions be tried to complement current programs (almost all of which have an individual focus). Evidence that social factors such as peer pressure and the social relations of race affect risk behavior is presented. Social interventions that are discussed include organizing drug injectors against AIDS in ways analogous to those in which gays organized against the epidemic, and finding ways to change large-scale social relationships that predispose people to inject drugs.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study examined whether networks of drug-injecting and sexual relationships among drug injectors are associated with individual human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) serostatus and with behavioral likelihood of future infection. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of 767 drug injectors in New York City was performed with chain-referral and linking procedures to measure large-scale (sociometric) risk networks. Graph-theoretic algebraic techniques were used to detect 92 connected components (drug injectors linked to each other directly or through others) and a 105-member 2-core within a large connected component of 230 members. RESULTS: Drug injectors in the 2-core of the large component were more likely than others to be infected with HIV. Seronegative 2-core members engaged in a wide range of high-risk behaviors, including engaging in risk behaviors with infected drug injectors. CONCLUSIONS: Sociometric risk networks seem to be pathways along which HIV travels in drug-injecting peer groups. The cores of large components can be centers of high-risk behaviors and can become pockets of HIV infection. Preventing HIV from reaching the cores of large components may be crucial in preventing widespread HIV epidemics.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study sought to assess relations of laws prohibiting over-the-counter syringe sales (anti-OTC laws) to population prevalence of injection drug users and HIV prevalence or incidence among 96 US metropolitan areas. METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis was used. RESULTS: Metropolitan areas with anti-OTC laws had a higher mean HIV prevalence (13.8% vs 6.7%) than other metropolitan areas (pseudo-P < .001). In 83 metropolitan areas with HIV prevalence of less than 20%, anti-OTC laws were associated with HIV incidence rates of 1% or greater (pseudo-P < .001). Population proportions of injection drug users did not vary by presence of anti-OTC laws. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-OTC laws are not associated with lower population proportions of injection drug users. Laws restricting syringe access are associated with HIV transmission and should be repealed.

AB  - This article discusses ways in which randomized controlled trials do not accurately measure the impact of HIV behavioral interventions. This is because: 1. Such trials measure the wrong outcomes. Behavior change may have little to do with changes in HIV incidence since behavior change in events between HIV-concordant people have no impact on incidence. Even more important, the comparison of HIV incidence rates between study arms of individual-level RCTs does not measure the true outcome of interest-whether or not the intervention reduces HIV transmission at the community level. This is because this comparison cannot measure the extent to which the intervention stops transmission by HIV-infected people in the study to those outside it. (And this is made even worse if HIV-infected are excluded from the evaluation of the intervention.) 2. There are potential harms implicit in most cognitively oriented behavioral interventions that are not measured in current practice and may not be measurable using RCTs. Intervention trials often reinforce norms and values of individual self-protection. They rarely if ever measure whether doing this reduces community trust, solidarity, cohesion, organization, or activism in ways that might facilitate HIV transmission. 3. Many interventions are not best conceived of as interventions with individuals but rather with networks, cultures of risks, or communities. As such, randomizing individuals leads to effective interventions that diffuse protection through a community; but these are evaluated as ineffective because the changes diffuse to the control arm, which leads to systematic and erroneous reductions in the evaluated effectiveness as RCTs measure it. The paper ends by discussing research designs that are superior to individual-level RCTs at measuring whether an intervention reduces or increases new HIV transmission.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We tested the hypothesis that higher rates of previous hard drug-related arrests predict lower rates of injection drug use. METHODS: We analyzed drug-related arrest data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Uniform Crime Reporting Program for 93 large US metropolitan statistical areas in 1992 to 2002 to predict previously published annual estimates of the number of injection drug users (IDUs) per 10,000 population. RESULTS: In linear mixed-effects regression, hard drug-related arrest rates were positively associated (parameter = +1.59; SE = 0.57) with the population rate of IDUs in 1992 and were not associated with change in the IDU rate over time (parameter = -0.15; SE = 0.39). CONCLUSIONS: Deterrence-based approaches to reducing drug use seem not to reduce IDU prevalence. Alternative approaches such as harm reduction, which prevents HIV transmission and increases referrals to treatment, may be a better foundation for policy.

AB  - Little is known about group memberships of people who inject drugs (PWID). Three hundred PWID were interviewed about formal and informal group participation and risk behaviors. Many took part in groups related to problems and resources associated with injecting drugs, religion, sports or gender. Harm reduction group and support group participation was associated with less risk behavior; sports groups participation with more risk behavior. Group involvement by PWID may be important to their lives and/or affect prevention or infectious disease transmission. More research is needed about determinants and consequences of their and other drug users' group memberships.

AB  - The altruism and/or solidarity of people who inject drugs helps protect sex and drug partners from HIV. Research has been hindered by lack of measures. We developed and administered scales to assess them to 300 people who inject drugs. Altruism and Solidarity Scales were both internally consistent. Each correlated significantly with measures of helping others. These measures appear reliable and valid. They can be used to study how big events or structural interventions affect altruism and solidarity, and how altruism and solidarity are associated with changes in HIV or other risks, among people who inject drugs.

AB  - Large-scale structural interventions and "Big Events" like revolutions, wars and major disasters can affect HIV transmission by changing the sizes of at-risk populations, making high-risk behaviors more or less likely, or changing contexts in which risk occurs. This paper describes new measures to investigate hypothesized pathways that could connect macro-social changes to subsequent HIV transmission. We developed a "menu" of novel scales and indexes on topics including norms about sex and drug injecting under different conditions, experiencing denial of dignity, agreement with cultural themes about what actions are needed for survival or resistance, solidarity and other issues. We interviewed 298 at-risk heterosexuals and 256 men who have sex with men in New York City about these measures and possible validators for them. Most measures showed evidence of criterion validity (absolute magnitude of Pearson's r ≥ 0.20) and reliability (Cronbach's alpha ≥ 0.70). These measures can be (cautiously) used to understand how macro-changes affect HIV and other risk. Many can also be used to understand risk contexts and dynamics in more normal situations. Additional efforts to improve and to replicate the validation of these measures should be conducted.

AB  - Attacks on peoples' dignity help to produce and maintain stigmatization and interpersonal hostility. As part of an effort to develop innovative measures of possible pathways between structural interventions or socially-disruptive Big Events and HIV outbreaks, we developed items to measure dignity denial. These measures were administered to 300 people who inject drugs (PWID), 260 high-risk heterosexuals who do not inject drugs, and 191 men who have sex with men who do not inject drugs (MSM). All of the PWID and many of the high risk heterosexuals and MSM were referred to our study in 2012-2015 by a large New York city study that used respondent-driven sampling; the others were recruited by chain-referral. Members of all three key populations experienced attacks on their dignity fairly often and also reported frequently seeing others' dignity being attacked. Relatives are major sources of dignity attacks. MSM were significantly more likely to report having their dignity attacked by police officers than were the other groups. 40 % or more of each key population reported that dignity attacks are followed "sometimes" or more often both by using more drugs and also by using more alcohol. Dignity attacks and their health effects require more research and creative interventions, some of which might take untraditional forms like social movements.

AB  - This paper describes the evaluation of interagency collaboration in a network of child-serving providers as part of the evaluation of the Bridgeport Safe Start Initiative (BSSI). In line with the system of care approach, the objectives of BSSI included reducing fragmentation of efforts and delivering integrated services to families of young children exposed to or at risk of exposure to family violence. Interagency collaboration was examined via social network and focus group data collected at three time points starting at baseline. Network analysis findings suggest that over time the network structure became consistent with BSSI's vision of an ideal collaborative network structure. Focus group findings, however, present a more complex picture of the status of collaboration. This paper sheds light on approaches and challenges to measuring interagency collaboration in a service delivery system and communicating social network analysis findings to stakeholders in a way that is accessible and useful.

AB  - Epidemics have been important in human history. This article discusses epidemics as part of a metabolic dialectics of humanity within nature. The creative thoughts and actions of those people most threatened by HIV/AIDS, and the thoughts and actions of science, have shaped both each other and the virus. The virus has reacted through mutation in ways that mimic strategic intelligence. The dialectics of capital and states has shaped these interactions and, in some cases, been shaped by them. Practical action to minimize the harms epidemics do can be strengthened by understanding of these epidemics, and Marxist theory and practices can be strengthened by understanding the dialectics of public health and the struggles around it more fully.

AB  - The term "Big Events" began as a way to help understand how wars, transitions and other crises shape long-term HIV epidemiology in affected areas. It directs attention to the roles of ordinary people in shaping these outcomes. Big Events themselves can take years, as in long-term armed struggles like those in Colombia and also long-term political and economic changes like the turn over the last 15 years of many Latin American countries away from neoliberalism and towards attempts to build solidarity economies of some form. The effects of Big Events on HIV epidemics, at least, may run in phases: In the short term, by creating vulnerability to epidemic outbreaks among existing Key Populations like people who inject drugs (PWID) or men who have sex with men (MSM); then, in their non-PWID (or non-MSM) risk networks; and perhaps, several years later, among youth who became involved in high-risk sexual or drug use networks and behaviors due to the social impacts of the Big Event. Issues of time loom large in other articles in this Special Issue as well. Some articles and commentaries in this issue point to another important phenomenon that should be studied more: The positive contributions that people who use drugs and other members of the population make towards helping other people in their communities during and after Big Events. Finally, this Commentary calls for more thought and research about an impending very Big Event, global climate change, and how it may exacerbate HIV, hepatitis C and other epidemics among people who use drugs and other members of their networks and communities.

AB  - Political-economic transitions in the Soviet Union, Indonesia, and China, but not the Philippines, were followed by HIV epidemics among drug users. Wars also may sometimes increase HIV risk. Based on similarities in some of the causal pathways through which wars and transitions can affect HIV risk, we use the term "Big Events" to include both. We first critique several prior epidemiological models of Big Events as inadequately incorporating social agency and as somewhat imprecise and over-generalizing in their sociology. We then suggest a model using the following concepts: first, event-specific HIV transmission probabilities are functions of (a) the probability that partners are infection-discordant; (b) the infection-susceptibility of the uninfected partner; (c) the infectivity of the infected--as well as (d) the behaviours engaged in. These probabilities depend on the distributions of HIV and other variables in populations. Sexual or injection events incorporate risk behaviours and are embedded in sexual and injection partnership patterns and community networks, which in turn are shaped by the content of normative regulation in communities. Wars and transitions can change socio-economic variables that can sometimes precipitate increases in the numbers of people who engage in high-risk drug and sexual networks and behaviours and in the riskiness of what they do. These variables that Big Events affect may include population displacement; economic difficulties and policies; police corruption, repressiveness, and failure to preserve order; health services; migration; social movements; gender roles; and inter-communal violence--which, in turn, affect normative regulation, youth alienation, networks and behaviours. As part of these pathways, autonomous action by neighbourhood residents, teenagers, drug users and sex workers to maintain their economic welfare, health or happiness may affect many of these variables or otherwise mediate whether HIV epidemics follow transitions. We thus posit that research on whether and how these interacting causal pathways and autonomous actions are followed by drug-related harm and/or HIV or other epidemics can help us understand how to intervene to prevent or mitigate such harms.

AB  - A positive-deviance control-case life history study of injection drug users (IDUs) in New York City who had injected drugs for 8-15 years compared 21 IDUs who were antibody negative for both HIV and hepatitis C with 3 infected with both viruses and 11 infected with hepatitis C virus but not HIV. Eligible subjects were referred from other research studies and from community organizations that conduct testing for HIV and hepatitis C virus. Data were collected during 2005-2008 and were analyzed using life history and grounded theory approaches. They support grounded hypotheses that IDUs who are able to attain symbiotic goals like avoiding withdrawal and maintaining social support are assisted thereby in remaining uninfected with HIV or hepatitis C. These hypotheses should be tested using cohort studies and prevention trials to see if helping IDUs attain symbiotic goals reduces infection risk. The study's limitations are noted.

AB  - Economic and political instability and related "big events" are widespread throughout the globe. Although they sometimes lead to epidemic HIV outbreaks, sometimes they do not-and we do not understand why. Current behavioural theories do not adequately address these processes, and thus cannot provide optimal guidance for effective intervention. Based in part on a critique of our prior "pathways" model of big events, we suggest that cultural-historical activity theory (CHAT) may provide a useful framework for HIV research in this area. Using CHAT concepts, we also suggest a number of areas in which new measures should be developed to make such research possible.

AB  - Social researchers and epidemiologists, as well as their major institutions and the general public, have been slow to address the racial and ethnic aspects of the AIDS epidemic. Whether measured by categories associated with major routes of infection, age level, gender, or by diminished length of survival, blacks and Hispanics are disproportionately affected by AIDS. Education, care, and outreach efforts based upon stereotypes of gay white males will have to yield to greater attention to cultural differences--and potential strengths--within each of the special "communities at risk." Evidence indicates areas of social resistance along with unique possibilities for change.

AB  - The harm reduction movement formed during a period in which social movements of the working class and the excluded were weak, neo-liberalism ideologically triumphant, and potential opposition movements were viewed as offering "tinkering" with the system rather than a total social alternative. This climate shaped and limited the perspectives, strategies, and tactics of harm reductionists almost everywhere. In many countries, this period was also marked by a "political economy of scapegoating" that often targeted drug users as the cause of social woes. This scapegoating took the form of "divide and rule" political initiatives by business and political leaderships to prevent social unrest in a long period of worldwide economic trends toward lowered profit rates and toward increasing income inequality. However, times have changed. Mass strikes and other labor struggles, opposition to the World Trade Organisation and other agencies of neo-liberalism, community-based protests against belt-tightening, and other forms of social unrest have been increasing in many countries. This opens up the possibility of new allies for the harm reduction movement, but also poses difficult problems for which we need to develop answers. On-the-ground experience in alliance formation needs to be combined with careful discussion of and research about what approaches work to convince other movements to work for and with harm reduction, and which approaches do not. Class differences within the harm reduction movement are likely to become more salient in terms of (a) creating internal tensions, (b) increasingly, opening up new ways in which working class harm reductionists can organize within their own communities and workplaces, and (c) producing different strategic orientations that will need to be discussed and debated. As a movement, we will need to find ways to accommodate and discuss differing perspectives, needs, and assessments of opportunities and threats without paralyzing harm reduction activities.

AB  - AIMS: A prior study concluded that drug treatment coverage, defined as the percentage of injection drug users in drug treatment, varied from 1 percent to 39 percent (median 9 percent) in 96 metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) in the United States. Here, we determine which metropolitan area characteristics are associated with drug treatment coverage. METHODS: We conducted secondary analysis of official data, including the number of injection drug users in treatment and other variables, for 94 large US MSAs. We estimated the number of injection drug users in these metropolitan areas using previously described methods. We used lagged cross-sectional analyses where the independent variables, chosen on the basis of a Theory of Community Action, preceded the dependent variable (drug treatment coverage) in time. Predictors were determined using ordinary least squares multiple regression and confirmed with robust regression. RESULTS: Independent predictors of higher drug treatment coverage for injectors were: presence of organisations that support treatment (unstandardized beta=1.64; 95 percent CI .59 to 2.69); education expenditures per capita in the MSA (unstandardized beta=.12; 95 percent CI -.34 to 2.69); lower percentage of drug users in treatment who are non-injection drug users (unstandardized beta=-0.18; 95 percent CI -0.24 to -0.12); higher percentage of the population who are non-Hispanic White (unstandardized beta=.14; 95 percent CI .08 to .20); lower per capita long-term debt of governments in the metropolitan area (unstandardized beta=-0.93; 95 percent CI -1.51 to -0.35). CONCLUSIONS: In conditions of scarce treatment coverage for drug injectors, an indicator of epidemiologic need (the per capita extent of AIDS among injection drug users) does not predict treatment coverage, and competition for treatment slots by non-injectors may reduce injectors' access to treatment. Metropolitan finances limit treatment coverage. Political variables (racial structures, the presence of organisations that support drug treatment, and budget priorities) may be important determinants of treatment coverage for injectors. Although confidence in these results would be higher if we had used a longitudinal design, these results suggest that further research and action that address structural, political, and other barriers to treatment expansion are sorely needed.

AB  - This paper reviews and then discusses selected findings from a seventeen year study about the population prevalence of people who inject drugs (PWID) and of HIV prevalence and mortality among PWID in 96 large US metropolitan areas. Unlike most research, this study was conducted with the metropolitan area as the level of analysis. It found that metropolitan area measures of income inequality and of structural racism predicted all of these outcomes, and that rates of arrest for heroin and/or cocaine predicted HIV prevalence and mortality but did not predict changes in PWID population prevalence. Income inequality and measures of structural racism were associated with hard drug arrests or other properties of policing. These findings, whose limitations and implications for further research are discussed, suggest that efforts to respond to HIV and to drug injection should include supra-individual efforts to reduce both income inequality and racism. At a time when major social movements in many countries are trying to reduce inequality, racism and oppression (including reforming drug laws), these macro-social issues in public health should be both addressable and a priority in both research and action.

AB  - This article estimates the population prevalence of current injection drug users (IDUs) in 96 large US metropolitan areas to facilitate structural analyses of its predictors and sequelae and assesses the extent to which drug abuse treatment and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) counseling and testing are made available to drug injectors in each metropolitan area. We estimated the total number of current IDUs in the United States and then allocated the large metropolitan area total among large metropolitan areas using four different multiplier methods. Mean values were used as best estimates, and their validity and limitations were assessed. Prevalence of drug injectors per 10,000 population varied from 19 to 173 (median 60; interquartile range 42-87). Proportions of drug injectors in treatment varied from 1.0% to 39.3% (median 8.6%); and the ratio of HIV counseling and testing events to the estimated number of IDUs varied from 0.013 to 0.285 (median 0.082). Despite limitations in the accuracy of these estimates, they can be used for structural analyses of the correlates and predictors of the population density of drug injectors in metropolitan areas and for assessing the extent of service delivery to drug injectors. Although service provision levels varied considerably, few if any metropolitan areas seemed to be providing adequate levels of services.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Among the largest US metropolitan areas, trends in mortality rates for injection drug users (IDUs) with AIDS vary substantially. Ecosocial, risk environment and dialectical theories suggest many metropolitan areas characteristics that might drive this variation. We assess metropolitan area characteristics associated with decline in mortality rates among IDUs living with AIDS (per 10,000 adult MSA residents) after highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was developed. METHODS: This is an ecological cohort study of 86 large US metropolitan areas from 1993-2006. The proportional rate of decline in mortality among IDUs diagnosed with AIDS (as a proportion of adult residents) from 1993-1995 to 2004-2006 was the outcome of interest. This rate of decline was modeled as a function of MSA-level variables suggested by ecosocial, risk environment and dialectical theories. In multiple regression analyses, we used 1993-1995 mortality rates to (partially) control for pre-HAART epidemic history and study how other independent variables affected the outcomes. RESULTS: In multivariable models, pre-HAART to HAART era increases in 'hard drug' arrest rates and higher pre-HAART income inequality were associated with lower relative declines in mortality rates. Pre-HAART per capita health expenditure and drug abuse treatment rates, and pre- to HAART-era increases in HIV counseling and testing rates, were weakly associated with greater decline in AIDS mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Mortality among IDUs living with AIDS might be decreased by reducing metropolitan income inequality, increasing public health expenditures, and perhaps increasing drug abuse treatment and HIV testing services. Given prior evidence that drug-related arrest rates are associated with higher HIV prevalence rates among IDUs and do not seem to decrease IDU population prevalence, changes in laws and policing practices to reduce such arrests while still protecting public order should be considered.

AB  - PURPOSE: We focus on a little-researched issue-how human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemics and programs in key populations in metropolitan areas affect epidemics in other key populations. We consider (1) How are earlier epidemics among people who inject drugs (PWID) and men who have sex with men (MSM) related to later AIDS incidence and mortality among heterosexuals?; (2) Were prevention programs targeting PWID or MSM associated with lower AIDS incidence and mortality among heterosexuals?; and (3) Was the size of the potential bridge population of noninjecting drug users (NIDUs) in a metropolitan area associated with later AIDS incidence and mortality among heterosexuals? METHODS: Using data for 96 large U.S. metropolitan areas, Poisson regression assessed associations of population prevalences of HIV-infected PWID and MSM (1992); NIDU population prevalence (1992-1994); drug use treatment coverage for PWID (1993); HIV counseling and testing coverage for MSM and for PWID (1992); and syringe exchange presence (2000) with CDC data on AIDS incidence and mortality among heterosexuals in 2006-2008, with appropriate socioeconomic controls. RESULTS: Population density of HIV+ PWID and of NIDUs were positively related, and prevention programs for PWID negatively related to later AIDS incidence among heterosexuals and later mortality among heterosexuals living with AIDS. HIV+ MSM population density and prevention programs for MSM were not associated with these outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Efforts to reduce HIV transmission among PWID and NIDUs may reduce AIDS and AIDS-related mortality among heterosexuals. More research is needed at metropolitan area, network, and individual levels into HIV bridging across key populations and how interventions in one key population affect HIV epidemics in other key populations.

AB  - PURPOSE: This paper presents an overview of different kinds of risk and social network methods and the kinds of research questions each can address. RECENT FINDINGS: It also reviews what network research has discovered about how network characteristics are associated with HIV and other infections, risk behaviors, preventive behaviors, and care, and discusses some ways in which network-based public health interventions have been conducted. Based on this, risk and social network research and interventions seem both feasible and valuable for addressing the many public health and social problems raised by the widespread use of opioids in the US South.

AB  - Stigma is a fundamental driver of adverse health outcomes. Although stigma is often studied at the individual level to focus on how stigma influences the mental and physical health of the stigmatized, considerable research has shown that stigma is multilevel and structural. This paper proposes a theoretical approach that synthesizes the literature on stigma with the literature on scapegoating and divide-and-rule as strategies that the wealthy and powerful use to maintain their power and wealth; the literatures on racial, gender, and other subordination; the literature on ideology and organization in sociopolitical systems; and the literature on resistance and rebellion against stigma, oppression and other forms of subordination. we develop a model of the "stigma system" as a dialectic of interacting and conflicting structures and processes. Understanding this system can help public health reorient stigma interventions to address the sources of stigma as well as the individual problems that stigma creates. On a broader level, this model can help those opposing stigma and its effects to develop alliances and strategies with which to oppose stigma and the processes that create it.

AB  - Structural racism is increasingly recognized as a key driver of health inequities and other adverse outcomes. This paper focuses on structural racism as an "upstream" institutionalized process, how it creates health inequities and how structural racism persists in spite of generations of efforts to end it. So far, "downstream" efforts to reduce these health inequities have had little success in eliminating them. Here, we attempt to increase public health awareness of structural racism and its institutionalization and sociopolitical supports so that research and action can address them. This paper presents both a theoretic and an analytic approach to how structural racism contributes to disproportionate rates of HIV/AIDS and related diseases among oppressed populations. We first discuss differences in disease and health outcomes among people who use drugs (PWUD) and other groups at risk for HIV from different racial and ethnic populations. The paper then briefly analyzes the history of racism; how racial oppression, class, gender and other intersectional divisions interact to create health inequities; and how structural racism is institutionalized in ways that contribute to disease disparities among people who use drugs and other people. It examines the processes, institutions and other structures that reinforce structural racism, and how these, combined with processes that normalize racism, serve as barriers to efforts to counter and dismantle the structural racism that Black, indigenous and Latinx people have confronted for centuries. Finally, we discuss the implications of this analysis for public health research and action to undo racism and to enhance the health of populations who have suffered lifetimes of racial/ethnic oppression, with a focus on HIV/AIDS outcomes.

AB  - Questionnaire data from almost 12,000 street-recruited drug injectors in 19 cities were analyzed to determine racial differences that may affect transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Self-reported sexual behaviors of drug injectors differ by city-type. White male drug injectors reported less unprotected vaginal sex than black or Latino males in multicultural--black/white/Mexican-origin and biracial cities. Black drug users of both sexes were less likely than white or Latino drug users to report unprotected and sex in multicultural--black/white/Mexican-origin and multicultural--black/white/Puerto Rican cities. The reported percentage of sex acts in which a condom was used was similar for black, white, and Puerto Rican men, and for black and white women, in all city types, but Puerto Rican women reported more condom use than black women. Mexican-origin drug injectors of each gender were least likely to report using condoms in multicultural--black/white/Mexican-origin cities. Black drug injectors are particularly likely to report having sex partners who do not inject drugs, as are Puerto Rican men and as are whites in multicultural--black/white/Mexican-origin cities. High-risk sex without condoms is widely reported among all groups of drug injectors studied: Each racial/gender group in each city-type averaged 15 or more episodes of unprotected vaginal sex per month, and 10% of most subgroups report having anal sex within the past 6 months. At least 45% of subjects in each city-type reported sex with noninjectors of the opposite gender. Without continued and expanded intervention, these data are consistent with HIV spreading to drug injectors, their sexual partners, and their future children, in all racial/ethnic groups.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: In February 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration issued a guidance restricting the sales and distribution of cartridge-based e-cigarettes with flavours other than tobacco and menthol. Disposable devices were exempt from this guidance. This study examined the prevalence of disposable pod use and flavour preference compared with refillable pod and other e-cigarette users among vape shop customers. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: In July 2019-March 2020, trained data collectors visited 44 vape shops in California with permission to recruit customers from shop owners. PARTICIPANTS: Intercept interviews with 276 customers were conducted. OUTCOMES AND PROCEDURES: Customers were grouped based on self-reported device type used most often (disposable pod, refillable pod and other e-cigarettes). Groups were compared on self-reported demographics, flavours preferred, daily e-cigarette use, preferred nicotine concentration levels and cigarette use. RESULTS: Of the 276 customers surveyed, 11.2% used disposable pods in the past 30 days. Among disposable pod users, fruit/candy (80.7%), mint (77.4%) and menthol (67.7%) were common preferred flavours, while tobacco flavours were less commonly preferred (19.4%). When compared with refillable pod and other non-pod e-cigarette device users, disposable pod users were younger, used higher nicotine concentration levels, were more likely to prefer mint and menthol flavours and use e-cigarettes as their first product, while less likely to ever use cigarettes and use e-cigarettes daily. DISCUSSION: Despite using higher nicotine levels and preferred menthol/mint flavours more often than users of other devices, disposable pod users reported lower prevalence of lifetime smoking and daily vaping and were younger. Given the current findings, regulations addressing non-tobacco flavours and nicotine concentration in disposable pod devices merit consideration in efforts to reduce vaping in younger adult never smokers.

AB  - Peptides derived from the N- (N-HR) and C- (C-HR) terminal heptad repeat regions adjacent to the fusion peptide and transmembrane domains, respectively, of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 gp41 inhibit HIV-1 viral envelope glycoproteins (Env)-mediated cell fusion specifically. The mechanism of HIV-1 Env-mediated cell fusion and its inhibition by agents that target the N- and C-HR regions was investigated. Priming experiments with Env-expressing cells indicate that the N-HR region but not the C-HR region is exposed by treatment with sCD4 at 31 degrees C, whereas both the N- and C-HR regions are exposed at 37 degrees C.

AB  - The current general model of HIV viral entry involves the binding of the trimeric viral envelope glycoprotein gp120/gp41 to cell surface receptor CD4 and chemokine co-receptor CXCR4 or CCR5, which triggers conformational changes in the envelope proteins. Gp120 then dissociates from gp41, allowing for the fusion peptide to be inserted into the target membrane and the pre-hairpin configuration of the ectodomain to form. The C-terminal heptad repeat region and the leucine/isoleucine zipper region then form the thermostable six-helix coiled-coil, which drives the membrane merger and eventual fusion. This model needs updating, as there has been a wealth of data produced in the last few years concerning HIV entry, including target cell dependencies, fusion kinetic data, and conformational intermediates. A more complete model must include the involvement of membrane microdomains, actin polymerization, glycosphingolipids, and possibly CD4 and chemokine signaling in entry. In addition, kinetic experiments involving the addition of fusion inhibitors have revealed some of the rate-limiting steps in this process, adding a temporal component to the model. A review of these data that may require an updated version of the original model is presented here.

AB  - The onset of cell fusion mediated by HIV-1 IIIB Env is preceded by a lag phase of 15-20 min. Fusion mediated by the CD4-independent HIV-1 Env 8x, which is capable of interacting directly with CXCR4, proceeds with a greatly reduced lag phase. We probed the intermediate steps during the lag phase in HIV-1 IIIB Env-mediated fusion with Leu3-a, an inhibitor of attachment of gp120 to CD4, AMD3100, an inhibitor of attachment of gp120 to CXCR4, and C34, a synthetic peptide that interferes with the transition of gp41 to the fusion active state. Inhibitions of fusion as a function of time of addition of C34 and of AMD3100 were equivalent, indicating that engagement of gp120 by CXCR4 and formation of the gp41 six-helix bundle follow similar kinetics. The initial steps in fusion mediated by the CD4-independent Env 8x are too rapid for these inhibitors to interfere with. However, when 8x Env-expressing cells were incubated with target cells at 25 degrees C in the presence of AMD3100 or C34, prior to incubation at 37 degrees C, these inhibitors were capable of inhibiting 8x Env-mediated fusion. To further examine engagement of gp120 by CXCR4 and exposure of binding sites for C34, we have reversibly arrested the fusion reaction at 37 degrees C by adding cytochalasin B to the medium. We show that CXCR4 engagement and six-helix bundle formation only occur after the release of the cytochalasin arrest, indicating that a high degree of cooperativity is required to trigger the initial steps in HIV-1 Env-mediated fusion.

AB  - BACKGROUND: HIV envelope glycoprotein (Env)-mediated fusion is driven by the concerted coalescence of the HIV gp41 N-helical and C-helical regions, which results in the formation of 6 helix bundles. Kinetics of HIV Env-mediated fusion is an important determinant of sensitivity to entry inhibitors and antibodies. However, the parameters that govern the HIV Env fusion cascade have yet to be fully elucidated. We address this issue by comparing the kinetics HIV-1IIIB Env with those mediated by HIV-2 from two strains with different affinities for CD4 and CXCR4. RESULTS: HIV-1 and HIV-2 Env-mediated cell fusion occurred with half times of about 60 and 30 min, respectively. Binding experiments of soluble HIV gp120 proteins to CD4 and co-receptor did not correlate with the differences in kinetics of fusion mediated by the three different HIV Envs. However, escape from inhibition by reagents that block gp120-CD4 binding, CD4-induced CXCR4 binding and 6-helix bundle formation, respectively, indicated large difference between HIV-1 and HIV-2 envelope glycoproteins in their CD4-induced rates of engagement with CXCR4. CONCLUSION: The HIV-2 Env proteins studied here exhibited a significantly reduced window of time between the engagement of gp120 with CD4 and exposure of the CXCR4 binding site on gp120 as compared with HIV-1IIIB Env. The efficiency with which HIV-2 Env undergoes this CD4-induced conformational change is the major cause of the relatively rapid rate of HIV-2 Env mediated-fusion.

AB  - C-peptides derived from the HIV envelope glycoprotein transmembrane subunit gp41 C-terminal heptad repeat (C-HR) region are potent HIV fusion inhibitors. These peptides interact with the gp41 N-terminal heptad repeat (N-HR) region and block the gp41 six-helix bundle formation that is required for fusion. However, the parameters that govern this inhibition have yet to be elucidated. We address this issue by comparing the ability of C34, derived from HIV-1, HIV-2 and SIV gp41, to inhibit HIV-1, HIV-2 and SIV envelope-mediated fusion and the ability of these peptides to form stable six-helix bundles with N36 peptides derived from gp41 of these three viruses. The ability to form six-helix bundles was examined by circular dichroism spectroscopy, and HIV/SIV Env-mediated membrane fusion was monitored by a dye transfer assay. HIV-1 N36 formed stable helix bundles with HIV-1, HIV-2 and SIV C34, which all inhibited HIV-1 Env-mediated fusion at IC(50)<10nM. The three C34 peptides were poor inhibitors of HIV-2 and SIV fusion (IC(50)>100nM), although HIV-2 and SIV N36 formed stable helix bundles with SIV C34. Priming experiments with sCD4 indicate that, in contrast to HIV-1, HIV-2 and SIV Env do not expose their N-HR region to SIV C34 following CD4 binding, but rapidly proceed to co-receptor engagement and six-helix bundle formation resulting in fusion. Our results suggest that several factors, including six-helix bundle stability and the ability of CD4 to destabilize the envelope glycoprotein, serve as determinants of sensitivity to entry inhibitors.

AB  - Retrocyclin-1, a -defensin, protects target cells from human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1) by preventing viral entry. To delineate its mechanism, we conducted fusion assays between susceptible target cells and effector cells that expressed HIV-1 Env. Retrocyclin-1 (4 microm) completely blocked fusion mediated by HIV-1 Envs that used CXCR4 or CCR5 but had little effect on cell fusion mediated by HIV-2 and simian immunodeficiency virus Envs. Retrocyclin-1 inhibited HIV-1 Env-mediated fusion without impairing the lateral mobility of CD4, and it inhibited the fusion of CD4-deficient cells with cells bearing CD4-independent HIV-1 Env. Thus, it could act without cross-linking membrane proteins or inhibiting gp120-CD4 interactions. Retrocyclin-1 acted late in the HIV-1 Env fusion cascade but prior to 6-helix bundle formation. Surface plasmon resonance experiments revealed that retrocyclin bound the ectodomain of gp41 with high affinity in a glycan-independent manner and that it bound selectively to the gp41 C-terminal heptad repeat. Native-PAGE, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and CD spectroscopic analyses all revealed that retrocyclin-1 prevented 6-helix bundle formation. This mode of action, although novel for an innate effector molecule, resembles the mechanism of peptidic entry inhibitors based on portions of the gp41 sequence.

AB  - With the many recent improvements in the medical management of HIV, the benefits of early detection of the virus have increased. People found to be HIV-positive can be offered immediate referrals for medical care and a comprehensive continuum of services. However, it is estimated that, among the 650,000 to 900,000 seropositive persons in the United States, about one third are unaware of their serostatus. Many of those who are tested for HIV do not return for their results. Among those less likely to return for results are young people and black Americans. Many factors at the individual, system and societal levels negatively impact whether individuals at risk for HIV seek HIV testing in the first place, whether they return for their results, and whether they get appropriate care after they are found to be HIV-positive. Some solutions are offered to improve the identification of new HIV infections. These include social marketing campaigns to encourage individuals to be tested for HIV. Also, more use of the rapid HIV test, which will substantially increase the number of people obtaining their HIV results, is recommended. New computer technologies, such as telemedicine, also have the potential to improve linkages to care for newly diagnosed individuals. In addition, it is essential that HIV care continue to be readily available through the Ryan White Care Act.

AB  - Latinos in the United States are disproportionately impacted by HIV/AIDS. They accounted for 20.4% of the AIDS cases reported in 2003, despite the fact that they represent 13.3% of the civilian non-institutional population of the United States. Thus it is important to identify ways to increase HIV testing among Latinos engaging in high risk behaviors. One approach that has been proposed for increasing HIV testing is the "bundling" of HIV prevention interventions with other relevant services. This study examined whether offering HIV testing with screening for other conditions would increase HIV testing among Latino men who frequent gay bars. A cross-sectional survey of 394 Latino men was conducted at both urban and suburban gay bars. Overall, no statistical differences were found in the number of individuals who took the HIV test or who tested HIV-positive when the HIV test was offered with screening for other conditions (alcohol problems, drug dependence, depression, syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia) compared to when it was offered by itself. However, multivariate analysis found that three groups of Latino men were more likely to test for HIV when it was bundled with other tests: those who reported having sex primarily with women, those with other risk factors that could also be tested through a bundled test approach, and those who were clients of the suburban gay bar that was farthest from a large geographical gay community. Further studies of bundled HIV testing should be conducted with other key subpopulations that may be more willing to take an HIV test when it is offered with other relevant tests than when offered by itself.

AB  - In January 2005, passage of California Senate Bill 1159 enabled California's county or city governments to establish disease prevention demonstration projects (DPDPs) through which pharmacies could subsequently register to legally sell up to 10 syringes to adults without a prescription. California's 61 local health jurisdictions (LHJs) were surveyed annually in 2005-2007 to monitor the progress of DPDP implementation and assess program coverage, facilitators, and barriers. Completed surveys were returned by mail, fax, e-mail, phone, or internet. We analyzed 2007 survey data to describe current DPDP status; data from all years were analyzed for trends in approval and implementation status. By 2007, 17 (27.9%) LHJs approved DPDPs, of which 14 (82.4%) had registered 532 (17.8%) of the 2,987 pharmacies in these 14 LHJs. Although only three LHJs added DPDPs since 2006, the number of registered pharmacies increased 102% from 263 previously reported. Among the LHJs without approved DPDPs in 2007, one (2.3%) was in the approval process, seven (16.3%) planned to seek approval, and 35 (81.4%) reported no plans to seek approval. Of 35 LHJs not planning to seek approval, the top four reasons were: limited health department time (40%) or interest (34%), pharmacy disinterest (31%), and law enforcement opposition (26%). Among eight LHJs pursuing approval, the main barriers were "time management" (13%), educating stakeholders (13%), and enlisting pharmacy participation (13%). The17 LHJs with DPDP represent 52% of California's residents; they included 62% of persons living with HIV and 59% of IDU-related HIV cases, suggesting that many LHJs with significant numbers of HIV cases have approved DPDPs. Outcome studies are needed to determine whether SB 1159 had the desired impact on increasing syringe access and reducing blood-borne viral infection risk among California IDUs.

AB  - Apoptotic loss of CD4+ T cells has been proposed as a mechanism of T cell depletion in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections resulting in immunodeficiency. The Env glycoprotein has been implicated in apoptosis of uninfected bystander cells via gp120 binding to CD4/CXC chemokine receptor 4 as well as the fusion/hemifusion process mediated by gp41. Using an in vitro model of coculture of Env-expressing cells as effectors and CD4+ T cells as targets, we find that apoptosis mediated by Env glycoprotein in bystander cells in fact correlates with gp41-induced hemifusion. Further, the apoptotic pathway initiated by this interaction involves caspase-3-dependent mitochondrial depolarization and reactive oxygen species production. HIV gp41-induced mitochondrial depolarization is inhibited by protease inhibitor nelfinavir but not by other HIV protease inhibitors or inhibitors of calpain and cathepsin. This "kiss of death" (hemifusion) signaling pathway is independent of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and p53, making it distinct from the apoptosis seen in syncytia. We also show that virion-induced apoptosis is gp41-dependent. Our findings provide new insights into the mechanism via which HIV gp41 mediates apoptosis in bystander cells.

AB  - Mechanisms of HIV-mediated CD4+ T cell loss leading to immunodeficiency are amongst the most extensively studied yet unanswered questions in HIV biology. The level of CD4+ T cell depletion in HIV infected patients far exceeds the number of infected T cells, suggesting an indirect mechanism of HIV pathogenesis termed bystander cell death. Evidence is accumulating that the HIV envelope glycoprotein (Env) is a major determinant of HIV pathogenesis and plays a critical role in bystander cell death. The complex structure and function of HIV Env makes the determination of the mechanism of Env mediated apoptosis more complex than previously thought. This review will examine the complex relationship between HIV Env phenotype, coreceptor expression and immune activation in determining HIV pathogenesis. We review data here corresponding to the role of HIV Env hemifusion activity in HIV pathogenesis and how it interplays with other AIDS associated factors such as chemokine receptor expression and immune activation.

AB  - The interaction between HIV gp120 and galactose-containing cell surface glycolipids such as GalCer or Gb3 is known to facilitate HIV binding to both CD4+ as well as CD4- cells. In an effort to develop small molecule HIV-1 entry inhibitors with improved solubility and efficacy, we have synthesized a series of C-glycoside analogs of GalCer and tested their anti HIV-1 activity. The analogs were tested for gp120 binding using a HIV-1 (IIIB) V3-loop specific peptide. Two of the six analogs that interfered with gp120 binding also inhibited HIV Env-mediated cell-to-cell fusion and viral entry in the absence of any significant cytotoxicity. Analogs with two side chains did not show inhibition of fusion and/or infection under identical conditions. The inhibition of virus infection seen by these compounds was not coreceptor dependent, as they inhibited CXCR4, CCR5 as well as dual tropic viruses. These compounds showed inhibition of HIV entry at early steps in viral infection since the compounds were inactive if added post viral entry. Temperature-arrested state experiments showed that the compounds act at the level of virus attachment to the cells likely at a pre-CD4 engagement step. These compounds also showed inhibition of VSV glycoprotein-pseudotyped virus. The results presented here show that the glycoside derivatives of GalCer with simple side chains may serve as a novel class of small molecule HIV-1 entry inhibitors that would be active against a number of HIV isolates as well as other enveloped viruses.

AB  - In previous studies on mechanisms of HIV-1-mediated pathogenesis we showed that bystander apoptosis mediated by cell surface-expressed HIV-1 Env correlated with the fusogenic properties of the gp41 subunit of Env. A crucial step in HIV gp41-mediated fusion is the refolding of the protein into a six-helix bundle along the N- and C-terminal coiled-coil domains. These domains have been targeted by peptide inhibitors that inhibit gp41-mediated fusion. One of these inhibitors, enfuvirtide, is the first such drug approved for therapy. More recently, clinical data suggest that the beneficial effects of enfuvirtide extend beyond virus suppression and are associated with certain resistance mutations in gp41. In this study we characterized the bystander apoptosis-inducing potential of mutants associated with increased CD4 counts that arise during enfuvirtide therapy. Whereas all mutant clones were reduced in both cell-to-cell fusion activity and apoptosis induction there was limited effect on virus infection or replication. The viruses were found to have apoptosis-inducing activity in the order WT > V38M > V38A > G36D > V38E, which correlated with cell-to-cell fusion but not infection. Interestingly, the level of resistance as determined by the IC(50) of enfuvirtide also correlated inversely with both cell fusion and apoptosis in that the most resistant Envs were the least fusogenic and pathogenic. This suggests the beneficial effects of enfuvirtide therapy beyond virus suppression may be mediated by selecting less pathogenic HIV isolates over time.

AB  - The loss of CD4(+) T cells in HIV-1 infections is hypothesized to be caused by apoptosis of bystander cells mediated by cell surface-expressed HIV-1 Env glycoprotein. However, the mechanism by which Env mediates this process remains controversial. Specifically, the role of HIV-1 gp120 binding to CD4 and CXCR4 versus the fusion process mediated by gp41 remains unresolved. Env-induced apoptosis in bystander cells has been shown to be gp41-dependent and correlates with the redistribution of membrane lipids between Env-expressing cells and target cells (hemifusion). Using a rational mutagenesis approach aimed at targeting Env function via the gp41 subunit, we examined the role of HIV gp41 in bystander apoptosis. A mutation in the fusion domain of gp41 (V513E) resulted in a fusion-defective Env that failed to induce apoptosis. A mutation in the gp41 N-terminal helix (G547D) reduced cell fusion capacity and apoptosis; conversely, an Env mutant with a deletion of the gp41 cytoplasmic tail (Ct Del) enhanced both cell-to-cell fusion and apoptosis. Most significantly, an Env mutant containing a substitution in the loop region of gp41 (D589L) mediated transfer of lipids (hemifusion) to bystander cells but was defective in cell-to-cell and to a lesser degree virus-to-cell fusion. This mutant was still able to induce apoptosis in bystander cells. Hence, we have provided the first direct evidence that gp41-mediated hemifusion is both required and sufficient for induction of apoptosis in bystander cells. These results may help to explain the mechanism of HIV-1 Env-induced T cell depletion.

AB  - HIV gp41 is a metastable protein whose native conformation is maintained in the form of a heterodimer with gp120. The non-covalently associated gp41/gp120 complex forms a trimer on the virus surface. As gp120 engages with HIV's receptor, CD4, and coreceptor, CXCR4 or CCR5, gp41 undergoes several conformational changes resulting in fusion between the viral and cellular membranes. Several lipophilic and amphiphilic domains have been shown to be critical in that process. While the obvious function of gp41 in viral entry is well-established its role in cellular membrane fusion and the link with pathogenesis are only now beginning to appear. Recent targeting of gp41 via fusion inhibitors has revealed an important role of this protein not only in viral entry but also in bystander apoptosis and HIV pathogenesis. Studies by our group and others have shown that the phenomenon of gp41-mediated hemifusion initiates apoptosis in bystander cells and correlates with virus pathogenesis. More interestingly, recent clinical evidence suggests that gp41 mutants arising after Enfuvirtide therapy are associated with CD4 cell increase and immunological benefits. This has in turn been correlated to a decrease in bystander apoptosis in our in vitro as well as in vivo assays. Although a great deal of work has been done to unravel HIV-1 gp41-mediated fusion mechanisms, the factors that regulate gp41-mediated fusion versus hemifusion and the mechanism by which hemifusion initiates bystander apoptosis are not fully understood. Further insight into these issues will open new avenues for drug development making gp41 a critical anti-HIV target both for neutralization and virus attenuation.

AB  - The N-terminal fusion peptide (FP) of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) is a potent inhibitor of cell-cell fusion, possibly because of its ability to recognize the corresponding segments inside the fusion complex within the membrane. Here we show that a fusion peptide in which the highly conserved Ile(4), Phe(8), Phe(11), and Ala(14) were replaced by their d-enantiomers (IFFA) is a potent inhibitor of cell-cell fusion. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy confirmed that despite these drastic modifications, the peptide preserved most of its structure within the membrane. Fluorescence energy transfer studies demonstrated that the diastereomeric peptide interacted with the wild type FP, suggesting this segment as the target site for inhibition of membrane fusion. This is further supported by the similar localization of the wild type and IFFA FPs to microdomains in T cells and the preferred partitioning into ordered regions within sphingomyelin/phosphatidyl-choline/cholesterol giant vesicles. These studies provide insight into the mechanism of molecular recognition within the membrane milieu and may serve in designing novel HIV entry inhibitors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite great improvements in prevention over the last years, much has to be done to reduce new human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections. Substantial evidence shows that the six-month period of recent HIV infection contributes disproportionately to HIV transmission. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate knowledge, normative beliefs, and attitudes of people who inject drugs (PWID) regarding recent HIV infection. METHODS: People who inject drugs in Athens, Greece were recruited in the fifth round of a respondent- driven sampling program (ARISTOTLE). The participants were tested for HIV and answered a structured questionnaire, which also included items on knowledge, normative beliefs, and attitudes regarding recent infection to address needs of the social network-based Transmission Reduction Intervention Project. The multivariable analyses included logistic regression models, which produced odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: In total, 1,407 people (mean age: 36.3 ± 7.9 years old; males: 81.9%) took part in the fifth round of ARISTOTLE. Of these, 61.5% knew that HIV-infected people who are not on treatment are more likely to transmit HIV during the first six months of their infection and 58.4% reported that people in their network would react positively towards a recently HIV-infected person. People who inject drugs who were knowledgeable of recent HIV infection were more likely to disagree with statements such as that one should avoid all contact with a person recently infected by HIV (adjusted OR: 1.510, 95% CI: 1.090, 2.091) or more likely to agree with statements such as that an HIV+ person is much less likely to transmit HIV when h/she is on combination antiretroviral treatment (adjusted OR: 2.083, 95% CI: 1.231, 3.523). CONCLUSION: A considerable proportion of PWID in Athens, Greece, were aware of the high HIV transmission risk of recent HIV infection, although improvement is needed for some population segments. People who inject drugs who were knowledgeable of the role of recent HIV infection were more likely to have normative beliefs and attitudes that favor behaviors that could help rather than harm or stigmatize people who have recently been infected with HIV. Interventions that are based on the role of recent HIV infection in HIV transmission could be important to HIV prevention.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Syringe services programs (SSPs) are effective venues for delivering harm-reduction services to people who inject drugs (PWID). However, SSPs often face significant barriers to implementation, particularly in the absence of known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) outbreaks. METHODS: Using an agent-based model, we simulated HIV transmission in Scott County, Indiana, a rural county with a 1.7% prevalence of injection drug use. We compared outcomes arising in the absence of an SSP, in the presence of a pre-existing SSP, and with implementation of an SSP after the detection of an HIV outbreak among PWID over 5 years following the introduction of a single infection into the network. RESULTS: In the absence of an SSP, the model predicted an average of 176 infections among PWID over 5 years or an incidence rate of 12.1/100 person-years. Proactive implementation averted 154 infections and decreased incidence by 90.3%. With reactive implementation beginning operations 10 months after the first infection, an SSP would prevent 107 infections and decrease incidence by 60.8%. Reductions in incidence were also observed among people who did not inject drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Based on model predictions, proactive implementation of an SSP in Scott County had the potential to avert more HIV infections than reactive implementation after the detection of an outbreak. The predicted impact of reactive SSP implementation was highly dependent on timely implementation after detecting the earliest infections. Consequently, there is a need for expanded proactive SSP implementation in the context of enhanced monitoring of outbreak vulnerability in Scott County and similar rural contexts.

AB  - We examined the therapeutic efficacy of 131I-labeled murine monoclonal antibody (MAb) PAM4 against human pancreatic cancers carried as xenografts in athymic nude mice. Animals bearing the CaPan1 tumor (0.2 cm3) were either untreated or were given, 131I-labeled nonspecific Ag8 antibody. By week 7 mean tumor size had grown 16.5 +/- 8.4-fold and 4.2 +/- 2.5-fold for the untreated and 131I-Ag8-treated animals, respectively. In contrast, animals administered 131I-PAM4 exhibited marked regression of tumors to an average of 15% of initial tumor volume. Since most pancreatic cancer patients present with large tumor burdens, the limitation of 131I-PAM4 treatment with respect to initial tumor size was investigated in animals bearing tumors of approximately 0.5 cm3, 1.0 cm3 and 2.0 cm3. Significant extension of survival time (>3-fold increase) was noted for both the 0.5 cm3 and 1.0 cm3 131I-PAM4-treated groups, compared to their respective untreated controls. Even in the group bearing large 2.0-cm3 tumors, survival was increased 2-fold over the control group. To further improve anti-tumor effects in large tumors, 2 injections of 131I-PAM4 were administered at a 4-week interval to animals bearing tumors of approximately 1.0 cm3. Significant extended survival was noted for the group receiving 2 doses when compared to the group receiving only 1 dose.

AB  - Several domains of CD4 have been suggested to play a critical role in events that follow its binding to the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope glycoprotein (gp120-gp41). It has been reported previously that cells expressing a chimeric molecule consisting of the first 177 residues of human CD4 attached to residues from the hinge, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains of human CD8 did not form syncytia with HIV-1-infected cells (L. Poulin, L.A. Evans, S. Tang, A. Barboza, H. Legg, D.R. Littman, and J.A. Levy, J. Virol. 65: 4893-4901, 1991). In contrast, we found that the hybrid CD4.CD8 molecule expressed in human cells did render them susceptible to fusion with cells expressing HIV-1IIIB or HIV-1RF envelope glycoproteins encoded by vaccinia virus recombinants, but only after long lag times. The lag time of membrane fusion mediated by the hybrid CD4.CD8 molecule was fivefold longer than that for the wild-type CD4 molecule. However, the rate of binding to and the affinity of soluble gp120 for membrane-associated CD4.CD8 were the same as for CD4. Both molecules were laterally mobile, as determined by patching experiments. Coexpression of the CD4.CD8 chimera with wild-type CD4 did not lead to interference in fusion but had an additive effect. Therefore, the proximal membrane domains of CD4 play an important role in determining the kinetics of postbinding events leading to membrane fusion. We hypothesize that the long lag time is due to the inability of the CD4.CD8-gp120-gp41 complex to undergo the rapid conformational changes which occur during the fusion mediated by wild-type CD4.

AB  - The possible contribution of Ag-specific Ig receptors on B cells to syncytium formation with HIV-1 envelope (env)-expressing cells was examined. A unique model system was designed that used anti-TNP/TNP interactions between a panel of TNP-specific human B cell lines and TNP-haptenated HIV-1 env-expressing T cells. The prototype B cell line 1:13 (CD4dull) produced few syncytia with vaccinia gp120/41-infected CD4- T cell effectors. However, TNP-haptenation of the HIV-1 env-expressing cells resulted in a five- to 10-fold increase in syncytium formation. The "enhanced" syncytia were blocked by OKT4A mAb, soluble CD4, anti-TNP serum, and TNP-BSA, suggesting a role for both CD4 and Ig receptors. In contrast, the number of syncytia formed between CD4+ CEM T cells and TNP-haptenated effectors was reduced by 30 to 40%, compared with the unhaptenated effectors, suggesting that a fraction of the TNP haptens bound close to the CD4 binding regions on the gp120 envelope, which was confirmed by other experiments. The possibility that B cells specific for the CD4 binding site on HIV-1 gp120 may be involved in syncytium formation with HIV-1 env-expressing cells was tested by screening a panel of five hybrid B cell lines from HIV-1-seropositive individuals. One of these lines produced anti-gp120 antibodies, which bound near the CD4 binding site, and also formed syncytia with HIV-1 env-expressing cells. This study suggests that, in addition to CD4 receptors, certain B cell Ig receptors that bind to gp120 may induce conformational changes leading to cell fusion and their elimination.

AB  - A recently developed sensitive assay to examine the early stages of HIV-1 env-mediated cell fusion is based on the redistribution of fluorescent dyes between membranes and cytoplasm of adjacent cells, monitored by fluorescence video microscopy. This assay demonstrated that membrane fusion can occur under conditions where no syncytia are formed. Fusion started earlier than syncytia formation and was not very sensitive to HIV-1 env+/CD4+ cell ratios. In the current study, this assay was used to determine the role of LFA-1 in HIV-1 env-mediated membrane fusion and syncytia formation. CD4- LFA-1- Epstein-Barr virus transformed lines from two leukocyte adhesion deficiency patients were infected with recombinant vaccinia expressing gp120/41 (HIV-IIIB), and cocultured with CD4+ subclones of the human T cell line CEM, which were generated by chemical mutagenesis and express either normal (LFA-1+), or low levels of LFA-1 (LFA-1lo). It was found that the LFA-1lo T-cell clone formed much smaller and fewer syncytia compared to the LFA-1+ subclones, but both clones fused equally well with the gp120/41 expressing LFA-1- B cells as monitored by redistribution of fluorescent dyes. Furthermore, monoclonal antibodies against the LFA-1 molecules reduced the number of syncytia formed but had no effect on membrane fusion. These findings demonstrate that the adhesion molecule LFA-1 does not play a crucial role in the early events of HIV-1 env-mediated cell membrane fusion, but may contribute to the later events leading to giant cell formation.

AB  - The phorbol ester phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) strongly inhibits human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-induced syncytium formation; it has been suggested that this inhibitory effect is due to the transient downmodulation of the surface-associated CD4 receptors by PMA (I. H. Chowdhury, Y. Koyanagi, S. Kobayashi, Y. Hamamoto, H. Yoshiyama, T. Yoshida, and N. Yamamoto, Virology 176:126-132, 1990). Surprisingly, PMA treatment of cells expressing truncated (A2.01.CD4.401) and hybrid (A2.01.CD4.CD8) CD4 molecules, which are not downmodulated (P. Bedinger, A. Moriarty, R. C. von Borstel II, N. J. Donovan, K. S. Steimer, and D. R. Littman, Nature [London] 334:162-165, 1988), inhibited their fusion with CD4- (12E1) cells expressing vaccinia virus-encoded HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (gp120-gp41) and with chronically HIV-1-infected H9 (MN, IIIB, or RF) cells. PMA pretreatment of T (12E1) and non-T (HeLa, U937.3, and Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B) cell lines expressing vaccinia virus-encoded CD4 also blocked fusion with 12E1 cells expressing vaccinia virus-encoded gp120-gp41. Interestingly, pretreatment of the gp120-gp41-expressing 12E1 cells with PMA did not alter their fusion with untreated CD4-expressing cells. Although the inhibitory effect of PMA was rapid and treatment for 1.5 h with 5 ng of PMA per ml was sufficient to reduce fusion by more than 50%, the recovery after treatment was slow and more than 40 h was needed before the cells regained half of their fusion potential. The inhibitory effect of PMA was blocked by staurosporine in a dose-dependent fashion, suggesting that it is mediated by protein kinase C. PMA treatment of A2.01.CD4.401 cells reduced the number of infected cells 6.7-fold, as estimated by a quantitative analysis of the HIV-1 MN infection kinetics, probably by affecting the stage of virus entry into cells. CD26 surface expression was not significantly changed by PMA treatment. We conclude that PMA inhibits the CD4-gp120-gp41-mediated fusion by modulating an accessory component(s), different from CD26, in the target CD4-expressing cells. These findings suggest a novel approach for identification of accessory molecules involved in fusion and may have implications for the development of antiviral agents.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The US is in the midst of a national Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) epidemic that appears to be driven by new cases among people who inject drugs (PWID). While HCV transmission among PWID is believed to occur mostly through direct sharing of syringes, some infections may be spread via secondary processes and materials involved in injecting. OBJECTIVES: Here, we present the prevalence of secondary blood exposures on clothing and nearby surfaces after injection episodes and examine the correlations of these exposures to lifetime HCV infection among a targeted sample of 553 PWID in Los Angeles and San Francisco, California in 2016-18. RESULTS: In multivariate logistic regression models, higher odds of blood on clothing in the last 30 days was significantly (p < 0.05) associated with lifetime positive HCV status, opioids as primary drug, injecting with others, sharing cookers, and receptive syringe sharing. Higher adjusted odds of blood on nearby surfaces in the last 30 days was significantly associated with lifetime positive HCV status, sharing cookers, and receptive syringe sharing. Native American race was associated with significantly lower adjusted odds of both outcome variables. Conclusions/Importance: Results indicate the relevance of physical and social micro-environments to the potential for blood exposures secondary to injection episodes. Individuals with chronic HCV seropositivity are potentially more likely to expose others to blood due to decreases in the blood's ability to clot. This highlights the need for increased HCV testing at harm reduction sites and increased supply of first aid and wound-care materials to help stop potential blood exposures after injection episodes.

AB  - While most studies of AIDS risk behavior rely on self-reports, few studies have assessed the reliability of these reports. The present study examines self-reports of drug-related and sexual risk behavior among pairs of injecting drug users (IDUs) recruited from the streets in New York City. Since both members of the pair were interviewed, it was possible to compare their responses in order to assess reliability. Subjects reported on their contacts' demographic data (age, gender, race/ethnicity) and on shared risk behaviors, including syringe sharing. Despite the private and/or illegal nature of AIDS risk behaviors, IDU subjects were generally reliable in their reports of both demographic and AIDS risk behaviors.

AB  - Most research on the benefits of syringe exchange programs (SEPs) has focused on assessing program effectiveness and identifying risk profiles of SEP customers. To our knowledge, no empirical studies have considered the psychosocial characteristics of IDUs who do and do not use SEPs. To determine whether IDUs who do and do not use SEPs differ along demographic, psychosocial, and HIV risk characteristics and behaviors, we analyzed data from a three-city (Chicago, IL; Hartford, CT; Oakland, CA) observational study of how HIV prevention messages and supplies diffuse from SEPs. The study sample consisted of 350 participants with no reported history of HIV, hepatitis B or C virus infection. Self-efficacy was the only psychosocial factor to differentiate SEP customers from all non-customers groups; injecting others and pre-injection cleaning of the injection site differentiated some non-customers from customers. Implications for future interventions are discussed.

AB  - Syringe exchange programs (SEPs) can reduce HIV risk among injecting drug users (IDUs) but their use may depend heavily on contextual factors such as local syringe policies. The frequency and predictors of transitioning over time to and from direct, indirect, and non-use of SEPs are unknown. We sought, over one year, to: (1) quantify and characterize transition probabilities of SEP attendance typologies; (2) identify factors associated with (a) change in typology, and (b) becoming and maintaining Direct SEP use; and (3) quantify and characterize transition probabilities of SEP attendance before and after changes in policy designed to increase access. Using data collected from 583 IDUs participating in a three-city cohort study of SEPs, we conducted a latent transition analysis and multinomial regressions. Three typologies were detected: Direct SEP users, Indirect SEP users and Isolated IDUs. Transitions to Direct SEP use were most prevalent. Factors associated with becoming or maintaining Direct SEP use were female sex, Latino ethnicity, fewer injections per syringe, homelessness, recruitment city, injecting speedballs (cocaine and heroin), and police contact involving drug paraphernalia possession. Similar factors influenced transitions in the syringe policy change analysis. Policy change cities experienced an increase in Indirect SEP users (43-51%) with little increased direct use (29-31%). We found that, over time, IDUs tended to become Direct SEP users. Policies improving syringe availability influenced SEP use by increasing secondary syringe exchange. Interactions with police around drug paraphernalia may encourage SEP use for some IDUs and may provide opportunities for other health interventions.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) is the standard treatment for reducing severe visual loss from proliferative diabetic retinopathy. However, PRP can damage the retina, resulting in peripheral vision loss or worsening diabetic macular edema (DME). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the noninferiority of intravitreous ranibizumab compared with PRP for visual acuity outcomes in patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized clinical trial conducted at 55 US sites among 305 adults with proliferative diabetic retinopathy enrolled between February and December 2012 (mean age, 52 years; 44% female; 52% white). Both eyes were enrolled for 89 participants (1 eye to each study group), with a total of 394 study eyes. The final 2-year visit was completed in January 2015. INTERVENTIONS: Individual eyes were randomly assigned to receive PRP treatment, completed in 1 to 3 visits (n = 203 eyes), or ranibizumab, 0.5 mg, by intravitreous injection at baseline and as frequently as every 4 weeks based on a structured re-treatment protocol (n = 191 eyes). Eyes in both treatment groups could receive ranibizumab for DME. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was mean visual acuity change at 2 years (5-letter noninferiority margin; intention-to-treat analysis). Secondary outcomes included visual acuity area under the curve, peripheral visual field loss, vitrectomy, DME development, and retinal neovascularization. RESULTS: Mean visual acuity letter improvement at 2 years was +2.8 in the ranibizumab group vs +0.2 in the PRP group (difference, +2.2; 95% CI, -0.5 to +5.0; P < .001 for noninferiority). The mean treatment group difference in visual acuity area under the curve over 2 years was +4.2 (95% CI, +3.0 to +5.4; P < .001). Mean peripheral visual field sensitivity loss was worse (-23 dB vs -422 dB; difference, 372 dB; 95% CI, 213-531 dB; P < .001), vitrectomy was more frequent (15% vs 4%; difference, 9%; 95% CI, 4%-15%; P < .001), and DME development was more frequent (28% vs 9%; difference, 19%; 95% CI, 10%-28%; P < .001) in the PRP group vs the ranibizumab group, respectively. Eyes without active or regressed neovascularization at 2 years were not significantly different (35% in the ranibizumab group vs 30% in the PRP group; difference, 3%; 95% CI, -7% to 12%; P = .58). One eye in the ranibizumab group developed endophthalmitis. No significant differences between groups in rates of major cardiovascular events were identified. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among eyes with proliferative diabetic retinopathy, treatment with ranibizumab resulted in visual acuity that was noninferior to (not worse than) PRP treatment at 2 years. Although longer-term follow-up is needed, ranibizumab may be a reasonable treatment alternative, at least through 2 years, for patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

AB  - Drug injectors are at risk for infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other blood-borne pathogens through the exchange of (infected) blood resulting from unhygienic injecting practices. Research attention and public discussion have focused primarily on the sharing of syringes and needles. While the focus on syringe sharing has sparked important interventions (bleach distribution, syringe exchange) it may have obscured the social relationship in which injecting equipment is used. Drug sharing plays a crucial role in the social organization of the drug using subculture. In this paper, various drug sharing practices and other distinguishable aspects of the injecting process-collectively termed Syringe-Mediated Drug Sharing (SMDS)-are described. All of these behaviors may put injecting drug users (IDUs) at risk for infection. The purpose of this paper is to stimulate scientific inquiry into SMDS behaviors and the social contexts which shape them. Descriptions are based primarily on field studies in Rotterdam and New York City. Recommendations for safer injecting training and education are proposed, as are directions for future research.

AB  - Since 1980, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) have translated scientific evidence into clinical practice guidelines with recommendations to improve cardiovascular health. These guidelines, which are based on systematic methods to evaluate and classify evidence, provide a foundation for the delivery of quality cardiovascular care. The ACC and AHA sponsor the development and publication of clinical practice guidelines without commercial support, and members volunteer their time to the writing and review efforts. Clinical practice guidelines provide recommendations applicable to patients with or at risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD). The focus is on medical practice in the United States, but these guidelines are relevant to patients throughout the world. Although guidelines may be used to inform regulatory or payer decisions, the intent is to improve quality of care and align with patients’ interests. Guidelines are intended to define practices meeting the needs of patients in most, but not all, circumstances, and should not replace clinical judgment. Recommendations for guideline-directed management and therapy, which encompasses clinical evaluation, diagnostic testing, and both pharmacological and procedural treatments, are effective only when followed by both practitioners and patients. Adherence to recommendations can be enhanced by shared decision-making between clinicians and patients, with patient engagement in selecting interventions on the basis of individual values, preferences, and associated conditions and comorbidities. The ACC/AHA Task Force on Clinical Practice Guidelines strives to ensure that the guideline writing committee both contains requisite expertise and is representative of the broader medical community by selecting experts from a broad array of backgrounds, representing different geographic regions, sexes, races, ethnicities, intellectual perspectives/biases, and scopes of clinical practice, and by inviting organizations and professional societies with related interests and expertise to participate as partners or collaborators. The ACC and AHA have rigorous policies and methods to ensure that documents are developed without bias or improper influence. The complete policy on relationships with industry and other entities (RWI) can be found online. Beginning in 2017, numerous modifications to the guidelines have been and continue to be implemented to make guidelines shorter and enhance “user friendliness.” Guidelines are written and presented in a modular knowledge chunk format, in which each chunk includes a table of recommendations, a brief synopsis, recommendation-specific supportive text and, when appropriate, flow diagrams or additional tables. Hyperlinked references are provided for each modular knowledge chunk to facilitate quick access and review. More structured guidelines–including word limits (“targets”) and a web guideline supplement for useful but noncritical tables and figures–are 2 such changes. This Preamble is an abbreviated version, with the detailed version available online. The reader is encouraged to consult the full-text guideline for additional guidance and details, since the executive summary contains mainly the recommendations.
1. In all individuals, emphasize a heart-healthy lifestyle across the life course. A healthy lifestyle reduces atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk at all ages. In younger individuals, healthy lifestyle can reduce development of risk factors and is the foundation of ASCVD risk reduction. In young adults 20 to 39 years of age, an assessment of lifetime risk facilitates the clinician–patient risk discussion (see No. 6) and emphasizes intensive lifestyle efforts. In all age groups, lifestyle therapy is the primary intervention for metabolic syndrome. 2. In patients with clinical ASCVD, reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) with high-intensity statin therapy or maximally tolerated statin therapy. The more LDL-C is reduced on statin therapy, the greater will be subsequent risk reduction. Use a maximally tolerated statin to lower LDL-C levels by ≥50%. 3. In very high-risk ASCVD, use a LDL-C threshold of 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) to consider addition of nonstatins to statin therapy. Very high-risk includes a history of multiple major ASCVD events or 1 major ASCVD event and multiple high-risk conditions. In very high-risk ASCVD patients, it is reasonable to add ezetimibe to maximally tolerated statin therapy when the LDL-C level remains ≥70 mg/dL (≥1.8 mmol/L). In patients at very high risk whose LDL-C level remains ≥70 mg/dL(≥1.8 mmol/L) on maximally tolerated statin and ezetimibe therapy, adding a PCSK9 inhibitor is reasonable, although the long-term safety (>3 years) is uncertain and cost effectiveness is low at mid-2018 list prices. 4. In patients with severe primary hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C level ≥190 mg/dL [=4.9 mmol/L]), without calculating 10-year ASCVD risk, begin high-intensity statin therapy. If the LDL-C level remains ≥100 mg/dL (≥2.6 mmol/L), adding ezetimibe is reasonable. If the LDL-C level on statin plus ezetimibe remains ≥100 mg/dL (≥2.6 mmol/L) and the patient has multiple factors that increase subsequent risk of ASCVD events, a PCSK9 inhibitor may be considered, although the long-term safety (>3 years) is uncertain and economic value is low at mid-2018 list prices. 5. In patients 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes mellitus and LDL-C ≥70 mg/dL (≥1.8 mmol/L), start moderate-intensity statin therapy without calculating 10-year ASCVD risk. In patients with diabetes mellitus at higher risk, especially those with multiple risk factors or those 50 to 75 years of age, it is reasonable to use a high-intensity statin to reduce the LDL-C level by ≥50%. 6. In adults 40 to 75 years of age evaluated for primary ASCVD prevention, have a clinician–patient risk discussion before starting statin therapy. Risk discussion should include a review of major risk factors (eg, cigarette smoking, elevated blood pressure, LDL-C, hemoglobin A1C [if indicated], and calculated 10-year risk of ASCVD); the presence of risk-enhancing factors (see No. 8); the potential benefits of lifestyle and statin therapies; the potential for adverse effects and drug–drug interactions; consideration of costs of statin therapy; and patient preferences and values in shared decision-making. 7. In adults 40 to 75 years of age without diabetes mellitus and with LDL-C levels ≥70 mg/ dL (≥1.8 mmol/L), at a 10-year ASCVD risk of ≥7.5%, start a moderate-intensity statin if a discussion of treatment options favors statin therapy. Risk-enhancing factors favor statin therapy (see No. 8). If risk status is uncertain, consider using coronary artery calcium (CAC) to improve specificity (see No. 9). If statins are indicated, reduce LDL-C levels by ≥30%, and if 10-year risk is ≥20%, reduce LDL-C levels by ≥50%. 8. In adults 40 to 75 years of age without diabetes mellitus and 10-year risk of 7.5% to 19.9% (intermediate risk), risk-enhancing factors favor initiation of statin therapy (see No. 7). Risk-enhancing factors include family history of premature ASCVD; persistently elevated LDL-C levels ≥160 mg/dL (≥4.1 mmol/L); metabolic syndrome; chronic kidney disease; history of preeclampsia or premature menopause (age <40 years); chronic inflammatory disorders (eg, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, or chronic HIV); high-risk ethnic groups (eg, South Asian); persistent elevations of triglycerides ≥175 mg/dL (≥1.97 mmol/L); and, if measured in selected individuals, apolipoprotein B ≥130 mg/dL, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ≥2.0 mg/L, ankle-brachial index (ABI) <0.9 and lipoprotein (a) ≥50 mg/dL or 125 nmol/L, especially at higher values of lipoprotein (a). Risk-enhancing factors may favor statin therapy in patients at 10-year risk of 5% to 7.5% (borderline risk). 9. In adults 40 to 75 years of age without diabetes mellitus and with LDL-C levels ≥70 mg/dL to 189 mg/dL (≥1.8–4.9 mmol/L), at a 10-year ASCVD risk of ≥7.5% to 19.9%, if a decision about statin therapy is uncertain, consider measuring CAC. If CAC is zero, treatment with statin therapy may be withheld or delayed, except in cigarette smokers, those with diabetes mellitus, and those with a strong family history of premature ASCVD. A CAC score of 1 to 99 favors statin therapy, especially in those =55 years of age. For any patient, if the CAC score is ≥100 Agatston units or ≥75th percentile, statin therapy is indicated unless otherwise deferred by the outcome of clinician–patient risk discussion. 10. Assess adherence and percentage response to LDL-C–lowering medications and lifestyle changes with repeat lipid measurement 4 to 12 weeks after statin initiation or dose adjustment, repeated every 3 to 12 months as needed. Define responses to lifestyle and statin therapy by percentage reductions in LDL-C levels compared with baseline. In ASCVD patients at very high-risk, triggers for adding nonstatin drug therapy are defined by threshold LDL-C levels ≥70 mg/dL (≥1.8 mmol/L) on maximal statin therapy (see No. 3).

AB  - Introduction: Although a substantial body of research documents a relationship between traumatic stress in childhood and the initiation of substance use later in the life course, only limited research has examined potential linkages between adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and the initiation of non-medical prescription opioid use and other opioid use behaviors. The present study contributes to this growing body of work by investigating the association of childhood trauma with early initiation of a series of opioid use behaviors. Methods: New York City young adults (n = 539) ages 18-29 who reported non-medical use of prescription opioids or heroin use in the past 30 days were recruited using Respondent-Driven Sampling in 2014-16. Ten ACEs were assessed via self-report with the ACE Questionnaire. Associations between number of ACEs and self-reported ages of initiating seven opioid use behaviors (e.g., non-medical prescription opioid use, heroin use, heroin injection) were estimated with multivariable logistic regression. Results: Eighty nine percent of participants reported at least one ACE, and 46% reported four or more ACEs, a well-supported threshold indicating elevated risk for negative health consequences. Every increase of one trauma was associated with a 12-23% increase in odds of early initiation across the seven opioid use behaviors. Findings also document that the mean age at initiation increased with increasing risk severity across the behaviors, contributing to evidence of a trajectory from opioid pill misuse to opioid injection. Discussion: Increasing number of childhood traumas was associated with increased odds of earlier initiation of multiple opioid misuse behaviors. In light of prior research linking earlier initiation of substance use with increased substance use severity, present findings suggest the importance of ACEs as individual-level determinants of increased opioid use severity. Efforts to prevent onset and escalation of opioid use among at-risk youth may benefit from trauma prevention programs and trauma-focused screening and treatment, as well as increased attention to ameliorating upstream socio-structural drivers of childhood trauma.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the efficacy of a parent-based intervention to prevent sexual risk behavior among Latino and African American young adults. This was delivered to mothers while waiting for their adolescent child to complete an annual physical examination. Methods: A randomized clinical trial was conducted with 264 mother-adolescent dyads in New York City. Adolescents were eligible for the study only if they were African American or Latino and aged 11-14 years, inclusive. Dyads completed a brief baseline survey and were then randomly assigned to one of the following two conditions: (1) a parent-based intervention (n = 133), or (2) a "standard care" control condition (n = 131). Parents and adolescents completed a follow-up survey nine months later. The primary outcomes included whether the adolescent had ever engaged in vaginal sexual intercourse, the frequency of sexual intercourse, and the frequency of oral sex. Results: Relative to the control group, statistically significant reduced rates of transitioning to sexual activity and frequency of sexual intercourse were observed, with oral sex reductions nearly reaching statistical significance (p < .054). Specifically, sexual activity increased from 6% to 22% for young adults in the "standard of care" control condition, although it remained at 6% among young adults in the intervention condition at the 9-month follow-up. Conclusions: A parent-based intervention delivered to mothers in a pediatric clinic as they waited for their child to complete a physical examination may be an effective way to reduce sexual risk behaviors among Latino and African American middle-school young adults.

AB  - The present study examined the relationship among acculturation, familismo, and HIV-related adolescent sexual risk behavior. Data were collected from Latino mother-adolescent dyads to permit parent and adolescent analyses of familismo for predicting oral, vaginal, and anal sexual behaviors. A random sample of 702 Latino eighth-grade students and their mothers was recruited from New York City. The sample included Mexicans (n = 203), Puerto Ricans (n = 239), and Dominicans (n = 260). Acculturation was unrelated to sexual behavior, but adolescent familismo was related to girls' but not boys' sexual behavior. The most important facet of familismo was subjugation to the family, which was negatively associated with girls' sexual behavior. The implications for HIV prevention programs for Latino youth are discussed.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To date, most parent-based research has neglected the role of fathers in shaping adolescent sexual behavior and has focused on mothers. The objective of this study was to conduct a structured review to assess the role of paternal influence on adolescent sexual behavior and to assess the methodological quality of the paternal influence literature related to adolescent sexual behavior. METHODS: We searched electronic databases: PubMed, PsychINFO, Social Services Abstracts, Family Studies Abstracts, Sociological Abstracts, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature. Studies published between 1980 and 2011 that targeted adolescents 11 to 18 years and focused on paternal parenting processes were included. Methodological quality was assessed by using an 11-item scoring system. RESULTS: Thirteen articles were identified and reviewed. Findings suggest paternal factors are independently associated with adolescent sexual behavior relative to maternal factors. The most commonly studied paternal influence was emotional qualities of the father-adolescent relationship. Paternal communication about sex was most consistently associated with adolescent sexual behavior, whereas paternal attitudes about sex was least associated. Methodological limitations include a tendency to rely on cross-sectional design, nonprobability sampling methods, and focus on sexual debut versus broader sexual behavior. CONCLUSIONS: Existing research preliminarily suggests fathers influence the sexual behavior of their adolescent children; however, more rigorous research examining diverse facets of paternal influence on adolescent sexual behavior is needed. We provide recommendations for primary care providers and public health practitioners to better incorporate fathers into interventions designed to reduce adolescent sexual risk behavior.

AB  - CONTEXT: Latino and black adolescents are disproportionately affected by STDs, including HIV, and unintended pregnancies. Few parent-based interventions have targeted these youth, focused on early adolescence and had high participation rates. METHODS: Between 2003 and 2009, a randomized clinical trial was conducted with 2,016 Latino and black motheradolescent dyads in New York City. Adolescents were eligible if they were in grade 6 or 7. Dyads were assigned to one of three conditions: a parent-based intervention, Families Talking Together (FTT); an adolescent-only intervention, Making a Diff erence! (MAD); or a combined FTT+ MAD intervention. Respondents completed questionnaires at baseline and 12 months later. Single-degree-of-freedom contrasts and logistic regression analysis were used to evaluate diff erences in outcomes by intervention. RESULTS: The proportion of youth who reported ever having engaged in vaginal intercourse increased over the study period by eight percentage points among those in the MAD group, fi ve points in the FTT group and three points in the combined group; the diff erences among these increases were not statistically signifi cant. Adolescents in the two FTT groups were signifi cantly more likely than those in the MAD group to indicate that their mother had talked to them about not having intercourse (79% vs. 68%). They also scored higher than youth in the MAD group on measures of communication and perceived maternal attributes, and lower on activities that might lead to risky behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: The proportions of adolescents who initiated intercourse during the study period were not signifi cantly diff erent across groups, implying that the interventions were comparable. Findings suggest that FTT may have led to improved parenting behaviors. Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health, 2011, 43(4): 247-254, doi: 10.1363/ 4324711

AB  - Background. The incidence and prevalence of pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections among American adolescents remain unacceptably high. Purpose: This research examines adolescent intentions to have sexual intercourse, their expectancies about having sexual intercourse, and maternal communication about the expectancies of engaging in sexual intercourse. Methods: Six hundred sixty-eight randomly selected inner-city middle school students and their mothers completed self-administered questionnaires. Adolescents reported their intentions to have sexual intercourse and the perceived positive and negative expectancies of doing so. Both mothers and adolescents reported on the frequency of communication about these expectancies. Results. Boys reported higher intentions, more positive expectancies, and lower levels of maternal communication than did girls. Expectancies statistically significantly associated with intentions focused on the positive physical, social, and emotional advantages of having sex rather than on concerns about pregnancy and HIV/AIDS. With some exceptions, maternal communication was associated with adolescents' expectancies about engaging in sexual intercourse. However, only modest correlations between maternal and adolescent reports of communication were observed Conclusions. Results indicate that intervention programs should address the positive expectancies youth have about having sex, not just the threat of pregnancy and HIV/AIDS, and should address potential gender differences in expectancies between boys and girls.

AB  - In this study we have investigated a new class of cationic lipids--"bolaamphiphiles" or "bolas"--for their ability to efficiently deliver small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to cancer cells. The bolas of this study consist of a hydrophobic chain with one or more positively charged head groups at each end. Recently, we reported that micelles of the bolas GLH-19 and GLH-20 (derived from vernonia oil) efficiently deliver siRNAs, while having relatively low toxicities in vitro and in vivo. Our previous studies validated that; bolaamphiphiles can be designed to vary the magnitude of siRNA shielding, its delivery, and its subsequent release. To further understand the structural features of bolas critical for siRNAs delivery, new structurally related bolas (GLH-58 and GLH-60) were designed and synthesized from jojoba oil. Both bolas have similar hydrophobic domains and contain either one, in GLH-58, or two, in GLH-60 positively charged head groups at each end of the hydrophobic core. We have computationally predicted and experimentally validated that GLH-58 formed more stable nano sized micelles than GLH-60 and performed significantly better in comparison to GLH-60 for siRNA delivery. GLH-58/siRNA complexes demonstrated better efficiency in silencing the expression of the GFP gene in human breast cancer cells at concentrations of 5μg/mL, well below the toxic dose. Moreover, delivery of multiple different siRNAs targeting the HIV genome demonstrated further inhibition of virus production.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine lifetime correlates of HIV and hepatitis B and C (HBV and HCV) infections among noninjecting heroin users (NIUs). METHODS: Between March 1996 and March 2001, 483 eligible NIUs were tested for HIV, HBV, and HCV antibodies and administered structured interviews. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were stratified by injecting history. RESULTS: Among never-injectors (69.8%), significant (p <.05) correlates were unprotected sex with men who have sex with men (HIV and HBV), unprotected sex with NIUs (HIV), self-reported syphilis infection (HBV), longer duration of heroin use (HBV and HCV), shorter duration of cocaine use (HIV), blood transfusion before 1986 (HIV), and having been tattooed (HCV). Among former injectors (30.2%), significant correlates were receptive syringe sharing (HIV and HBV), frequent lifetime injection (HCV), longer duration of sexual activity (HBV), and having been tattooed (HCV). CONCLUSION: Never-injectors infected with HIV and HBV appear to have become infected mainly through sexual transmission, whereas former injectors appear to have become infected with HIV and HCV mainly though injecting risk and with HBV through both injecting and sexual risk. Interventions targeted at NIUs should prevent unsafe sex as well as the initiation or resumption of injecting. In addition, unhygienic tattooing, which may lead to HCV exposure, should be a focus of prevention efforts.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A substantial decline of HIV prevalence has been observed in injection drug users (IDUs) from Rio de Janeiro, in recent years. Differential characteristics and behaviors of new (injecting for <6 years) and long-term (>=6y) injectors may help to understand recent changes and to implement appropriate prevention strategies. METHODS: Between October 1999 and December 2001, 609 active/ex-IDUs were recruited from different communities, interviewed, and tested for HIV. Contingency table analysis and t-tests were used to assess differences between new and long-term injectors. Multiple logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors of HIV serostatus for long-term and new injectors. RESULTS: HIV prevalence was 11.7% for 309 long-term injectors (95% CI 8.1-15.3) and 4.3% for 300 new injectors (95% CI 2.0-6.6). New injectors reported having engaged in treatment and having received syringes from needle exchange programs (NEPs) more frequently than long-term injectors in the last 6 months, but sharing behaviors remained frequent and even increased vis-à-vis long-term injectors. For male new injectors, "sexual intercourse with another man" was found to be the sole significant risk factor for HIV infection (Adj OR = 8.03; 95% CI 1.52-42.48). Among male long-term injectors, "to have ever injected with anyone infected with HIV" (Adj OR = 3.91; 95% CI 1.09-14.06) and to have "ever been in prison" (Adj OR = 2.56; 95% CI 1.05-6.24) were found to be significantly associated with HIV infection. DISCUSSION: New injectors are seeking help in drug treatment centers or needle exchange programs. They differ from long-term injectors in terms of their risk factors for HIV infection and have lower prevalence levels for HIV. Such differences may help to understand the recent dynamics of HIV/AIDS in this population and highlight the need to reinforce new injectors' help-seeking behavior and to reduce current unacceptably high levels of unprotected sex and syringe sharing in new injectors despite attendance of prevention/treatment programs.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to study how structural determinants and the role of injecting drug users (IDUs) as a bridging population to the general population affected the AIDS subepidemic in southern Brazil during 1986-2000. Data from 288 southernmost Brazilian municipalities were analyzed. Using hierarchical modeling and inputs from a Geographic Information System, a multilevel model was constructed. The dependent variable was the logged AIDS standardized incidence rate (among the heterosexual population aged 15-69-years-old); independent variables included indicators for education, water provision, sewage, and garbage collection, per capita income, Gini coefficient (on income), Human Development Index, indicators of accessibility, and AIDS rate among IDUs. Significant predictors included AIDS rate among IDUs, distance from/to highways/railways, the Human Development Index and the ratio of residents who have access to sanitary installations. Poverty (as measured by socioeconomic indicators) and bridging from IDUs contribute to the spread of HIV/AIDS in Brazilian southern municipalities.

AB  - Background: Structural properties of sociometric networks have been associated with behaviors related to HIV transmission. Very few studies, however, have explored the correlation between sociometric network factors and drug injection-related norms. Methods: This exploratory work: (i) describes basic structural qualities of a sociometric risk network of participants in the Transmission Reduction Intervention Project (TRIP) in Athens, Greece, in the context of a large HIV outbreak among people who inject drugs (PWID); (ii) measures HIV prevalence within specific structures within the sociometric risk network of PWID in TRIP; and (iii) explores the association of structural properties of the sociometric risk network in TRIP with drug injection-related norms. Results: The sociometric risk network in TRIP consisted of a large component (n = 241, 67.8%), a few small components (n = 36, 10.1%) with 2-10 individuals each, and some isolates (n = 79, 22.2%). HIV prevalence was significantly higher in the large component (55.6%), the 2-core (59.1%) and 3-core (66.3%) of the large component, and the 3-cliques of the cores. Drug injection-related norms were significantly associated with structural characteristics of the sociometric risk network. A safe behavioral pattern (use of unclean cooker/filter/rinse water was never encouraged) was significantly (p = 0.03) less normative among people who TRIP participants of the 2-core injected with (40.5%) than among network contacts of TRIP participants outside the 2-core (55.6%). On the contrary, at drug-using venues, 2-core members reported that safer behaviors were normative compared to what was reported by those without 2-core membership. Conclusions: Sociometric network data can give useful insights into HIV transmission dynamics and inform prevention strategies.Supplemental data for this article is available online at https://doi.org/10.1080/10826084.2021.1914103 .

AB  - Drug use involves social interactions. Therefore, norms in the proximal environment of people who inject drugs (PWID) can favor behaviors that may result in HIV transmission. This work aimed at studying drug injection-related norms and their potential association with risky behaviors among PWID in Athens, Greece, in the context of economic recession and political activism that followed the fiscal crisis and soon after a recent HIV outbreak had leveled off. The Transmission Reduction Intervention Project (TRIP) was a social network-based approach (June 2013 to July 2015) that involved two groups of PWID seeds-with recent HIV infection and with long-term HIV infection and one control group of HIV-negative PWID. Network contacts of seeds were also enrolled. TRIP participants answered a questionnaire that included items on injection-related norms and behaviors. TRIP recruited 320 PWID (HIV positive, 44.4%). TRIP participants, especially those without HIV, often recalled or perceived as normative among their partners and in their networks some behaviors that can lead to HIV transmission. TRIP participants who recalled that they were encouraged by their regular drug partners to use an unclean syringe were almost twice as likely to report that they share syringes [odds ratio (OR) = 2.03; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.86-2.21], or give syringes to someone else (OR = 1.70; 95% CI = 1.42-2.04) as those who did not recall such an encouragement. Associations were modified by HIV status. HIV negatives, who were reportedly encouraged to share nonsyringe injecting equipment, were almost 4.5 times as likely to share that material as HIV-negative participants who were not encouraged (OR = 4.59, 95% CI = 4.12-5.11). Further research is needed on the multiple determinants (social, economic, and political) of norms in the social environments of PWID. Since peer norms are associated with risky behaviors, interventions should be developed to encourage norms and peer pressure against the sharing of injection equipment.

AB  - Although European and Australian studies of syringe exchange programs have reported safer injection among participants and no increase in drug use, the generalizability of these findings to the US is uncertain. We report on the operations and potential effectiveness of the longest-operating syringe exchange in the US and compare our results to studies of exchange programs outside the US. The sample of 204 study subjects reported no change in the frequency of injection, from 155 to 152 injections per month, and a decline in the frequency of unsafe injections, from 56 to 30 times per month, while participating in the program. In all studies, participants report reduction in unsafe injections, and no increase in illicit drug use. However, the comparison also suggests that a high proportion of Tacoma exchangers have higher initial rates of drug injection, unsafe injection and homelessness, all of which were associated with unsafe injection while using the exchange. These indicate a need for additional services but that the Tacoma program is no less effective than European and Australian programs.

AB  - For over a year, the Tacoma Syringe Exchange has been operating in spite of existing drug paraphernalia laws. One hundred fifty-four subjects have been interviewed regarding drug injection practices for the month prior to first use of the exchange and for the most recent month since using the exchange. Statistically significant reductions in mean frequency of obtaining used syringes, and in mean rate of passing on used syringes, have been reported. Mean number of times bleach was used to disinfect contaminated syringes has risen. The exchange continues to attract mainly men, median age 35, with a long history of injection. No differences have been observed in mean number of injections per month. In order to increase utilization, new sites are planned, but expansion has been hampered by a series of legal problems. Since the exchange draws many difficult to reach individuals, it is an important location for STD screening and drug treatment recruitment. Documentation of participation patterns and barriers to exchange use, and effects upon HIV serological status are recommended.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This case-control study examined the association between syringe exchange use and hepatitis B and C in injection drug users. METHODS: Case patients included 28 injection drug users with acute hepatitis B and 20 with acute hepatitis C reported to the health department in a sentinel hepatitis surveillance county; control subjects were injection drug users with no markers of exposure to hepatitis B or C (n = 38 and 26, respectively) attending health department services during the same period. Data were abstracted from clinic records. RESULTS: Seventy-five percent of case patients with hepatitis B and 26% of control subjects had never used the exchange; similar proportions were found for the hepatitis C case and control groups. After adjustment for demographic characteristics and duration of injecting drugs, nonuse of the exchange was associated with a sixfold greater risk of hepatitis B (odds ratio [OR] = 5.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.5, 20.4) and a sevenfold greater risk of hepatitis C (OR = 7.3; 95% CI = 1.6, 32.8). CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that use of the exchange led to a significant reduction in hepatitis B and hepatitis C in the county and may have also prevented a substantial proportion of human immunodeficiency virus infections in injection drug users.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Because Black men who have sex with men (BMSM) experience high rates of both HIV and incarceration relative to other groups, the various stages of criminal justice involvement may serve as important intervention points for addressing HIV and related conditions in this group. Although systematic reviews of HIV interventions targeting MSM in general and BMSM in particular exist, no review has explored the range and impact of HIV, sexually transmitted infection (STI), and substance use prevention and care continuum interventions focused on criminal justice-involved (CJI) populations. OBJECTIVES: To describe the range and impact of published HIV, STI, and related substance use interventions for US-based CJI populations and to understand their relevance for BMSM. SEARCH METHODS: We conducted systematic searches in the following databases: PubMed, MEDLINE, Cochrane, CINAHL, and PsycINFO, covering the period preceding December 1, 2016. SELECTION CRITERIA: We selected articles in scientific publications involving quantitative findings for studies of US-based interventions that focused on CJI individuals, with outcomes related to sexual or substance use risk behaviors, HIV, or STIs. We excluded studies if they provided no demographic information, had minimal representation of the population of interest (< 30 African American or Black male or transgender participants), had study populations limited to those aged younger than 18 years, or were limited to evaluations of preexisting programs. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We abstracted data from these articles on study design; years covered; study location; participant number, demographics, and sexual orientation (if available); criminal justice setting or type; health condition; targeted outcomes; and key findings. We scored studies by using the Downs and Black quality and bias assessment. We conducted linear regression to examine changes in study quality by publication year. MAIN RESULTS: Fifty-eight articles met inclusion criteria, including 8 (13.8%) modeling or cost-effectiveness studies and 13 (22.4%) randomized controlled trials. Just 3 studies (5.2%) focused on sexual or gender minorities, with only 1 focused on BMSM. In most studies (n = 36; 62.1%), however, more than 50% of participants were Black. The most common intervention addressed screening, including 20 empirical studies and 7 modeling studies. Education-focused interventions were also common (n = 15) and usually employed didactic rather than skill-building approaches. They were more likely to demonstrate increases in HIV testing, knowledge, and condom-use intentions than reductions in sex- and drug-risk behaviors. Screening programs consistently indicated cost-effectiveness, including with BMSM. Care continuum interventions for people living with HIV showed mixed results; just 3 involved randomized controlled trials, and these interventions did not show significant differences compared with control conditions. A minority of programs targeted non-custody-based CJI populations, despite their constituting a majority of the CJI population at any given time. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Screening CJI populations for HIV and other STIs is effective and cost-efficient and holds promise for reducing HIV in BMSM. Education-based and care provision interventions also hold promise for addressing HIV, STIs, mental health, and substance use in CJI populations. Additional empirical and modeling studies and results specific to sexual minorities are needed; their paucity represents a disparity in how HIV is addressed. Public Health Implications. HIV and STI screening programs focused on CJI populations should be a priority for reducing HIV risk and numbers of undiagnosed infections among BMSM. Funding agencies and public health leaders should prioritize research to improve the knowledge base regarding which care continuum intervention approaches are most effective for BMSM with criminal justice involvement. Developments in modeling approaches could allow researchers to simulate the impacts and costs of criminal justice involvement-related interventions that might otherwise be cost, time, or ethically prohibitive to study empirically.

AB  - We conducted a randomized controlled trial of a six-session behavioral intervention designed to reduce frequency of condomless sex and numbers of sex partners among recently incarcerated, bisexual Black men. One hundred participants were assigned to the small-group intervention, Men in Life Environments (MILE), and 112 were assigned to the control condition. Among those assigned to MILE, 69% attended at least one session, 88% of whom attended all sessions. At 3-months' follow-up, large reductions in risk behaviors were reported by both groups. Means for episodes of condomless sex in the previous 3 months declined from 27.7 to 8.0 for the intervention and 25.6 to 6.7 for the control group. Reductions were not greater for the intervention than those of the control group. Regression to the mean, respondent burden, and implementation issues, such as moving from office-based to field-based survey administration at follow-up, may have contributed to the large declines reported by both groups.

AB  - We developed and tested Passport to Wellness (PtW), a client-centered intervention to improve engagement in HIV/STI prevention and services to improve social determinants of health among Black men who have sex with men (BMSM) using incentives and peer support. We assessed PtW's impact on HIV/STI screening and pre/post-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP/PEP) knowledge/uptake using a randomized trial that compared the full intervention to one lacking peer support. We compared changes within groups surveyed at baseline and 6 months. We enrolled 80 eligible BMSM, among 399 screened. Among retained participants (34 peer-supported; 27 comparison), overall increases were observed in HIV (30% to 87%; p < .001) and STI (28% to 80%; p < .001) testing within the prior 6 months, as well as in PrEP and PEP awareness, and PrEP use. Statistically significant between group differences were not observed. Tailored prevention planning, incentives, and addressing social determinants may help move Black MSM along the HIV prevention continuum.

AB  - AIMS: To (i) describe an intervention implemented in response to the HIV-1 outbreak among people who inject drugs (PWIDs) in Greece (ARISTOTLE programme), (ii) assess its success in identifying and testing this population and (iii) describe socio-demographic characteristics, risk behaviours and access to treatment/prevention, estimate HIV prevalence and identify risk factors, as assessed at the first participation of PWIDs. DESIGN: A 'seek, test, treat, retain' intervention employing five rounds of respondent-driven sampling. SETTING: Athens, Greece (2012-13). PARTICIPANTS: A total of 3320 individuals who had injected drugs in the past 12 months. INTERVENTION: ARISTOTLE is an intervention that involves reaching out to high-risk, hard-to-reach PWIDs ('seek'), engaging them in HIV testing and providing information and materials to prevent HIV ('test') and initiating and maintaining anti-retroviral and opioid substitution treatment for those testing positive ('treat' and 'retain'). MEASUREMENTS: Blood samples were collected for HIV testing and personal interviews were conducted. FINDINGS: ARISTOTLE recruited 3320 PWIDs during the course of 13.5 months. More than half (54%) participated in multiple rounds, resulting in 7113 visits. HIV prevalence was 15.1%. At their first contact with the programme, 12.5% were on opioid substitution treatment programmes and the median number of free syringes they had received in the preceding month was 0. In the multivariable analysis, apart from injection-related variables, homelessness was a risk factor for HIV infection in male PWIDs [odds ratio (OR) yes versus no = 1.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.41, 2.52] while, in female PWIDS, the number of sexual partners (OR for > 5 versus one partner in the past year = 4.12, 95% CI = 1.93, 8.77) and history of imprisonment (OR yes versus no = 2.76, 95% CI = 1.43, 5.31) were associated with HIV. CONCLUSIONS: In Athens, Greece, the ARISTOTLE intervention for identifying HIV-positive people among people who inject drugs (PWID) facilitated rapid identification of a hidden population experiencing an outbreak and provided HIV testing, counselling and linkage to care. According to ARISTOTLE data, the 2011 HIV outbreak in Athens resulted in 15% HIV infection among PWID. Risk factors for HIV among PWID included homelessness in men and history of imprisonment and number of sexual partners in women.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To examine trends in state-level policy support for sexual minorities and HIV outcomes among men who have sex with men (MSM). METHODS: This longitudinal analysis linked state-level policy support for sexual minorities [N = 94 metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) in 38 states] to 7 years of data (2008-2014) from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on HIV outcomes among MSM. Using latent growth mixture modeling, we combined 11 state-level policies (eg, nondiscrimination laws including sexual orientation as a protected class) from 1999 to 2014, deriving the following 3 latent groups: consistently low policy support, consistently high policy support, and increasing trajectory of policy support. Outcomes were HIV diagnoses per 10,000 MSM, late diagnoses (number of deaths within 12 months of HIV diagnosis and AIDS diagnoses within 3 months of HIV diagnosis) per 10,000 MSM, AIDS diagnoses per 10,000 MSM with HIV, and AIDS-related mortality per 10,000 MSM with AIDS. RESULTS: Compared with MSAs in states with low policy support and increasing policy support for sexual minorities, MSAs in states with the highest level of policy support had lower risks of HIV diagnoses [risk difference (RD) = -37.9, 95% confidence interval (CI): -54.7 to -21.0], late diagnoses (RD = -12.5, 95% CI: -20.4 to -4.7), and AIDS-related mortality (RD = -33.7, 95% CI: -61.2 to -6.2), controlling for time and 7 MSA-level covariates. In low policy support states, 27% of HIV diagnoses, 21% of late diagnoses, and 10% of AIDS deaths among MSM were attributable to the policy climate. CONCLUSION: The state-level policy climate related to sexual minorities was associated with HIV health outcomes among MSM and could be a potential public health tool for HIV prevention and care.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence and correlates of attempted suicide among young injection drug users (IDUs) from six study sites in five US cities. Two thousand two hundred and nineteen participants 15-30 years of age underwent interviewer-administered questionnaires relating to self-reported drug use, sociodemographics, suicidal ideation and attempts, and exposure to violence. The 6-month prevalence of suicidal ideation and attempts was 35.8% (n = 795) and 7% (n = 156), respectively. Compared to those not reporting a recent (past 6 months) suicide attempt, those attempting suicide were more likely to have a lifetime history of mental health facility admission or sexual abuse. Participants receiving drug treatment at the time of the baseline interview (53.2% versus 37.1%, odds ratio [OR] = 1.93, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.39, 2.67) were also more likely to report a recent attempt; as were those reporting a history of experiencing violence. These associations persisted after adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, study site, and other significant covariates by multiple logistic regression. These data suggest that increased access to drug treatment, community mental health, and violence prevention programs may decrease suicidal behavior among young injection drug users.

AB  - AIMS: Injection drug use is a major risk factor for HIV and hepatitis infections. Whereas programs to prevent new infections have focused on HIV, they have generally neglected hepatitis B and C. This study was designed to examine the interrelationships among HIV and hepatitis knowledge, risky drug preparation and injection practices, and participation in syringe exchange programs (SEPs). DESIGN: Surveys of injection drug users (IDUs) collected data on socio-demographics, medical history, drug use and injection practices, and HIV- and hepatitis-related knowledge. SETTING: Inner-city US neighborhoods in Chicago, IL, Hartford, CT and Oakland, CA. PARTICIPANTS: The study population was a convenience sample of 493 IDUs recruited using street outreach and snowball sampling strategies. MEASUREMENTS: HIV and hepatitis knowledge, injection-related risks for virus transmission, associations between the two, and with SEP use. FINDINGS: HIV knowledge was significantly higher than hepatitis knowledge among SEP customers and non-customers alike. Elevated hepatitis knowledge was associated with a history of substance abuse treatment, hepatitis infection, hepatitis B vaccination and injection practices that reduced contact with contaminated blood or water but not with SEP use. SEP customers were consistently less likely to engage in risk behaviors, with the notable exception of safely staunching blood postinjection. CONCLUSION: Increased hepatitis awareness among IDUs is necessary for reducing hepatitis transmissions. Although SEPs continue to effectively disseminate HIV prevention messages-as evidenced by lowered risk behaviors among their customers-they must do more to prevent hepatitis transmissions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Comprehensive preventive services are recommended for injection drug users (IDU), including screening tests, vaccinations, risk reduction counseling, and sterile syringes. Syringe exchange programs (SEP) may facilitate receipt of preventive services by IDUs, but whether SEP clients receive recommended preventive care is not known. We examined use of recommended preventive services by clients of 23 SEPs throughout California. METHODS: Five hundred and sixty SEP clients were recruited from 23 SEPs throughout California between March and September 2003. Receipt of 10 recommended preventive services and source of care (SEP versus non-SEP providers) was ascertained from client interviews. RESULTS: On average, SEP clients received only 13% of recommended preventive services and 49% of clients received none of the recommended services. Of services that were received, 76% were received from SEPs. In multivariate analysis, use of drug treatment and more frequent SEP visits were associated with receipt of recommended preventive services by clients. CONCLUSIONS: SEPs are often the only source of preventive care for their IDU clients. Still, SEP clients fail to receive most recommended preventive services. Interventions to increase use of preventive services and improve the quality of preventive care received by IDUs, such as increased access to drug treatment and SEPs, are needed.

AB  - We described the availability and outcomes of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) testing services at syringe exchange programs throughout California, using interviews with 24 syringe exchange program directors and 560 syringe exchange clients. Both HIV and HCV testing services were available in 62% of programs, 21% had HIV testing only, and 17% had neither. Programs administered by health care/social service providers were more likely than independent syringe exchange programs to have HIV and HCV testing services available. Among clients of programs with testing available, clients of illegal programs were significantly less likely than clients of legal programs to have used syringe exchange HIV and HCV testing services. The availability of HIV and HCV testing services at syringe exchange programs varies, and the use of existing testing services by clients is not universal. Efforts to increase both the availability of HIV and HCV testing services at syringe exchange programs and the use of existing testing services are needed.

AB  - The initial period in the establishment of syringe exchange projects is often characterized by overt conflict: between community AIDS activists, on the one hand, and public officials and political leaders who remain ideologically opposed to the introduction of measures perceived as condoning illicit drug use. In this context, professionals concerned with legitimating the new institutions of syringe exchange may sometimes neglect aspects of their everyday logistics and social organization, obscuring the important choices which have to be made to carry these initiatives forward. In particular, the contrast between formally-constituted institutions-the "storefront" or "community-based" syringe exchange programs (SEPs)-and the model of low-threshold syringe availability through pharmacies, vending machines, and user networks, is here presented not as an either/or choice but rather as a pair of complementary strategies which respond to diverse needs and target different populations. The advantages and disadvantages of each particular approach make it likely that maximum effectiveness will be achieved through a combination of every possible form of needle distribution, each tailored to specific and cultural circumstances. The case is here examined in the light of the experience of the SEPs in New York City, from their clandestine origins in 1990 through their first years of official functioning in 1992-1996.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the attack rate for eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome and to identify potential risk factors for illness among patients attending a New York City medical clinic, who purchased L-tryptophan containing products produced exclusively by Showa Denko K.K. METHODS: A case-control design was used. Cases and controls purchased L-tryptophan containing products at the medical clinic from July 1, 1989--December 1, 1989. All case-patients identified with illness onset during the study period were included. Controls were selected by a systematic sample of the 683 purchasers of L-tryptophan attending the same clinic. RESULTS: Twelve (2.2%) of an estimated 553 L-tryptophan users were case-patients. Multivariate analysis suggested that lot 2 use (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 35.9), concomitant use of chromium (adjusted OR = 12.3), and concomitant use of pyridoxine (adjusted OR = 5.8) were associated with the development of illness. Chemical analysis of tablets corresponding to the 3 Showa Denko K.K. lots ingested by study participants showed that lot 2 had the highest concentration of ethylidenebis (L-tryptophan), a proposed causative agent or marker for a causative agent in the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Information from our study of persons exposed to implicated L-tryptophan supports the role for a contaminant as the causative agent in the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome and identifies possible cofactors that deserve further study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although effects of statins on cardiovascular outcomes are well established in men, fewer data exist for women. Furthermore, the effects of statins plus hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on cardiovascular outcomes are uncertain. METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined statin use, cardiovascular events, and total mortality in the Heart and Estrogen/progestin Replacement Study (HERS), a randomized clinical trial of estrogen plus progestin versus placebo in postmenopausal women with heart disease (n=2763). A nonrandomized comparison of statin users and nonusers revealed lower rates of the primary outcome, nonfatal myocardial infarction or coronary heart disease death (relative hazard [RH]=0.79, 95% confidence intervals [CI] 0.63 to 0.99, P=0.04), and total mortality (RH=0.67, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.87, P=0.003). Rates of venous thromboembolic events were also lower among statin users (RH=0.45, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.88, P=0.02). HRT resulted in a significant increase in early risk for primary events in women who did not use statins (RH=1.75, 95% CI 1.02 to 3.03, P=0.04) but not in statin users (RH=1.34, 95% CI 0.63 to 2.86, P=0.45). Adjustment for postrandomization statin use showed no effect of HRT on risk for the primary outcome (RH=0.96, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.29; P=0.72). CONCLUSIONS: In HERS, statin use was associated with lower rates of cardiovascular events, venous thromboembolic events, and total mortality. These data provide strong support for statin use in eligible women with coronary disease.

AB  - Background: Although black cisgender women in Chicago continue to disproportionally account for new HIV diagnoses, few are on pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). We used concurrent mixed-methods to understand women's PrEP knowledge, attitudes, experience, and preferences in Chicago. Setting and Methods: We surveyed 370 HIV(-) cisgender women visiting a sexually transmitted infection clinic (n = 120) or emergency department (n = 250). Two focus groups were conducted with PrEP-naive women, and interviews were conducted with 7 PrEP-experienced women. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression, and qualitative data using thematic analysis. Results: Majority of women identified as black (83.0%) and had a regular source of health care (70.0%). In the past 6 months, 84.1% had vaginal or anal sex, most with inconsistent condom use (94.2%). Only 30.3% had heard of PrEP, but once explained, one-quarter considered starting PrEP, with protecting health (76.4%) and reducing HIV worry (58.1%) the most common reasons. Factors associated with considering PrEP included being Latina [adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 3.30, 95% confidence interval (CI): (1.21 to 8.99)], recent sexually transmitted infection [aOR: 2.39, 95% CI: (1.25 to 4.59)], and higher belief in PrEP effectiveness [aOR: 1.85, 95% CI: (1.22 to 2.82)]. Most (81.1%) had concerns about taking PrEP with side effects a common concern. Qualitative themes aligned with survey results, revealing a disconnection from current PrEP marketing, need for community-level PrEP education/outreach, and importance of provider trust. Lessons Learned: Despite significant PrEP implementation work in Chicago, less than one-third of women in our study had heard of PrEP. Once informed, PrEP attitudes and interest were positive. Translating these results into interventions reflecting women's preferences and barriers is critical to increase PrEP uptake by cisgender women in Chicago and elsewhere.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Technology has changed the way that men who have sex with men (MSM) seek sex. More than 60% of MSM in the United States use the internet and/or smartphone-based geospatial networking apps to find sex partners. We correlated use of the most popular app (Grindr) with sexual risk and prevention behavior among MSM. METHODS: A nested cohort study was conducted between September 2018 and June 2019 among MSM receiving community-based human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and sexually transmitted infection (STI) screening in central San Diego. During the testing encounter, participants were surveyed for demographics, substance use, risk behavior (previous 3 months), HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) use, and Grindr usage. Participants who tested negative for HIV and who were not on PrEP were offered immediate PrEP. RESULTS: The study included 1256 MSM, 1090 of whom (86.8%) were not taking PrEP. Overall, 580 of 1256 (46%) participants indicated that they used Grindr in the previous 7 days. Grindr users reported significantly higher risk behavior (greater number of male partners and condomless sex) and were more likely to test positive for chlamydia or gonorrhea (8.6% vs 4.7% of nonusers; P = .005). Grindr users were also more likely to be on PrEP (18.7% vs 8.7% of nonusers; P < .001) and had fewer newly diagnosed HIV infections (9 vs 26 among nonusers; P = .014). Grindr users were also nearly twice as likely as nonusers to initiate PrEP (24.6% vs 14%; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Given the higher risk behavior and greater acceptance of PrEP among MSM who used Grindr, Grindr may provide a useful platform to promote HIV and STI testing and increase PrEP uptake.

AB  - Black men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women are disproportionately affected by criminal justice involvement (CJI) and HIV. This study recruited 618 young Black MSM and transgender women in Chicago, IL, using respondent-driven sampling between 2013 and 2014. Random effects logistic regression evaluated predictors of incident CJI over 18 months of follow-up. Controlling for respondent age, gender and sexual identity, spirituality (aOR 0.56, 95% CI 0.33-0.96), and presence of a mother figure (aOR 0.41, 95% CI 0.19-0.89) were protective against CJI. Economic hardship (financial or residential instability vs. neither aOR 2.23, 95% CI 1.10-4.51), two or more past episodes of CJI vs. none (aOR 2.66, 95% CI 1.40-5.66), and substance use (marijuana use vs. none aOR 2.79, 95% CI 1.23-6.34; other drug use vs. none aOR 4.49, 95% CI 1.66-12.16) were associated with CJI during follow-up. Research to identify and leverage resilience factors that can buffer the effects of socioeconomic marginalization may increase the effectiveness of interventions to address the socio-structural factors that increase the risk for CJI among Black MSM and transgender women. Given the intersection of incarceration, HIV and other STIs, and socio-structural stressors, criminal justice settings are important venues for interventions to reduce health inequities in these populations.

AB  - The intersection of the HIV and the chemokine fields began with the observation that HIV entry into cells could be blocked by certain chemokines. Subsequent work showed that HIV entry is dependent on the presence of specific chemokine receptors. These observations led us to evaluate a series of compounds, ureido analogs of distamycin previously reported to block HIV entry into cells in vitro, for chemokine antagonist activity. One of the distamycin analogs, 2,2'[4,4'-[[aminocarbonyl]amino]bis[N,4'-di[pyrrole-2-carboxamide- 1,1'-dimethyl]]-6,8 napthalenedisulfonic acid] hexasodium salt (NSC 651016), is shown here to inhibit syncytia formation and cell fusion. Mechanistic studies showed that this inhibition was not due to conformational changes in gp120-gp41 induced by target cell CD4 and chemokine co-receptor and was therefore not due to interference with binding of HIV-1. Additional mechanistic studies demonstrated that NSC 651016 inhibited chemokine binding to specific chemokine receptors, induced CXCR4 and CCR5 receptor internalization, and inhibited chemokine-induced chemotaxis by macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha, MIP-1beta, RANTES, and stromal-derived factor-1alpha but not monocyte chemotactic protein-1. Thus, we describe a novel compound that inhibits in vivo replication of HIV-1 by down-regulation of co-receptors. These data lead us to propose that NSC 651016 may have in vivo anti-inflammatory activity.

AB  - Treatment of human osteosarcoma cells, expressing CD4 and various chemokine receptors, with the glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor 1-phenyl-2-hexadecanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (PPMP), blocked target membrane glycosphingolipid (GSL) biosynthesis and reduced the susceptibility of cells to infection and fusion mediated by envelope glycoproteins from a variety of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) isolates that utilize CXCR4 and/or CCR5. PPMP treatment of the cell lines did not significantly change the cell surface expression of CD4, CXCR4, and/or CCR5, nor did it alter the chemokine receptor association with CD4. PPMP-treated cells exhibited no changes in chemokine-induced Ca(2+) mobilization and chemotaxis. However, massive envelope glycoprotein conformational changes triggered by CD4 and the appropriate chemokine receptor on the target membrane were inhibited when the target cells were treated with PPMP. Addition of various purified GSLs to PPMP-treated target cells showed that for all isolates tested, globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) was the most potent GSL in restoring the fusion susceptibility of target cells with cells expressing HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins; addition of the monosialoganglioside GM3 yielded a slight enhancement of fusion susceptibility. Our data are consistent with the notion that a limited number of specific GSL species serve as crucial elements in organizing gp120-gp41, CD4, and an appropriate chemokine receptor into a membrane fusion complex.

AB  - Introduction: Korean American emerging adult (KAEA) smokers represent a culturally and developmentally unique population constituted of primarily light, intermittent smokers. Sociocultural contexts might play an important role in contributing to instances of acute cigarette craving and motivation to smoke in this population; yet, research testing such hypotheses is scant. The current study tests whether and how social contexts are associated with the craving among KAEA smokers. Methods: Seventy-eight daily KAEA smokers, who smoke 4+ cigs/day, participated in a 7-day ecological momentary assessment (EMA), in which participants responded to both signal-contingent (random) and event contingent (smoking) prompts to answer surveys on their mobile phones (prompt-level n = 1377; 603 random +774 smoking prompts). Nicotine dependence was measured at baseline; cigarette craving, negative affect, presence of others smoking, social contexts were measured with EMA. Results: Modeling of within-participant variation and covariation showed that being with Korean friends (vs. alone) was associated with increased levels of momentary craving. This association between Korean friends and craving disappeared when adjusted for presence of others smoking, which was a strong predictor of momentary craving. The positive association between Korean friends and craving was amplified immediately prior to smoking (vs. non-smoking random) instances. Conclusions: Being with Korean friends might serve as a culturally-specific salient smoking cue, which might have been learned throughout their smoking history. Our data also showed that increased craving associated with Korean friends may represent social settings that primarily involve cigarette smoking. Given our findings on cigarette use among KAEA's social network, addressing cigarette use as a group behavior might be a fruitful intervention strategy. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Emerging adulthood (ages 18-25 years) has been associated with elevated substance use. Transitional life events (TLEs) during emerging adulthood in relation to substance use are usually examined separately, rather than as a constellation. The purposes of this study were (a) to explore distinct subgroups experiencing various TLEs during emerging adulthood, (b) to identify heterogeneous trajectories of cigarette and alcohol use during emerging adulthood, and (c) to examine the association of TLEs with cigarette and alcohol use trajectories. METHOD: Five waves of longitudinal data (mean age range: 19.5-26.0 years) were used from a community-based drug prevention program (n = 946, 49.9% female). Distinct subgroups of emerging adults who experienced various TLEs were identified using latent class analysis. Cigarette and alcohol use were examined using a latent growth mixture model. RESULTS: A three-class model fit the data best in identifying TLE subgroups (new family, college attenders [NFCA]; uncommitted relationships, college attenders [URCA]; hibernators [HBN]). Three-trajectory models fit the data best for cigarette and alcohol use during emerging adulthood. The TLE categories were significantly associated with the cigarette (p < .05) and alcohol use groups (p < .001); specifically, the URCA and HBN groups were significantly more likely to be classified as accelerating cigarette users, relative to NFCA (ps < .05). The NFCA and HBN groups were significantly more likely to be classified as accelerating alcohol users, relative to URCA (ps < .01). CONCLUSIONS: To characterize an "at-risk" emerging adult group for cigarette and alcohol use over time, a range of life events during emerging adulthood should be considered. Interventions tailored to young adulthood may benefit from targeting the absence of these life events typifying "independence" as a potential marker for underlying substance use problems and provide supplemental screening methods to identify young adults with similar issues.

AB  - Purpose. This study evaluated the effect of administering intermittent parathyroid hormone [PTH (1-34), henceforth PTH] on the early-stage bone healing of maxillary sinus augmentation in healthy rabbits. Materials and Methods. Bovine bone mineral was grafted on the sinuses of 20 female New Zealand white rabbits. The animals were randomly divided into two groups, PTH (n = 10) or saline (n = 10), in which either PTH or saline was injected subcutaneously 5 days a week for 2 weeks. Half of the animals in each group were killed at 2 weeks postoperatively and the other half were killed at 4 weeks postoperatively. The dosage of PTH was 10 μg/kg/day. Radiographic and histomorphometric analyses were performed. Result. The new bone area (NBA) did not differ significantly between the PTH and saline groups. The NBA in the PTH group in the total augmented area and in the demarcated window, center, and Schneiderian membrane regions increased significantly from 2 to 4 weeks. The number of osteoclasts decreased significantly from 2 to 4 weeks in both groups, with no difference between the two groups. Conclusion. Intermittent PTH might not stimulate new bone formation in healthy rabbits during the first 4 weeks of healing.

AB  - Kikuchi's disease is a fairly common self-limited disorder among Orientals that usually involves the cervical lymph nodes of young individuals and occurs predominantly in females. Frequently, the disease is associated with fever or flu-like symptoms, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), neutropenia, and lymphocytosis with atypical lymphocytes in the peripheral blood, suggesting a viral origin. However, no infectious agent has been identified. The presence of Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, known as human herpesvirus 8 (KSHV/HHV 8), was investigated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in archival tissue from 26 cases of Kikuchi's disease using published sequences of KSHV/HHV 8 as primers. PCR products were further characterized by Southern blot analysis. Forty reactive lymph nodes and a case of Kaposi sarcoma (KS) were included as negative and positive controls, respectively. Patients consisted of 10 men and 16 women with a mean age of 27 years. All patients were previously healthy and presented with cervical or axillary lymphadenopathy. None were positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or otherwise immunocompromised. Viral DNA was amplified by PCR in six cases of Kikuchi's disease (23%) and the control KS tissue. Southern blot analysis confirmed that the amplified products were KSHV/HHV 8. In the reactive lymph nodes, no viral genome was amplified by PCR. The presence of DNA sequences of KSHV/HHV 8 in a substantial portion of Kikuchi's disease suggests that KSHV/HHV 8 might play an important role in the pathogenesis of a subset of Kikuchi's disease.

AB  - This study examines the role of source trust in viral ad diffusion, specifically the impact of source trust on the reach and speed of ad diffusion. It tests the feasibility of using computer-algorithm-generated social media metrics, indicating the degree to which each person is trusted by others within a social network, for trust-based viral ad seeding strategy, and future research on viral advertising. Applying trust theory and the computational trust research approach using real-life viral ad cases, this study found that only a small proportion of social media users exposed to viral ads tend to contribute to ad diffusion, and those with higher trust scores make significantly stronger contributions to spreading viral ads faster and more broadly. Additionally, individuals' source trust scores have stronger impact on the extent and speed of viral ad diffusion, especially in the situation where the ads contained socially-controversial messages. Theoretical and methodological contributions and practical implications are offered.

AB  - Studies have shown positive impact of video blogs (vlogs) on patient education. However, we know little on how patient-initiated vlogs shape the relationships among vloggers and viewers. We qualitatively analyzed 72 vlogs on YouTube by users diagnosed with HIV, diabetes, or cancer and 1,274 comments posted to the vlogs to understand viewers' perspectives on the vlogs. We found that the unique video medium allowed intense and enriched personal and contextual disclosure to the viewers, leading to strong community-building activities and social support among vloggers and commenters, both informationally and emotionally. Furthermore, the unique communication structure of the vlogs allowed ad hoc small groups to form, which showed different group behavior than typical text-based social media, such as online communities. We provide implications to the Health Care Industry (HCI) community on how future technologies for health vlogs could be designed to further support chronic illness management.

AB  - Background: Online health community (OHC) moderators help facilitate conversations and provide information to members. However, the necessity of the moderator in helping members achieve goals by providing the support they need remains unclear, with some prior research suggesting that moderation is unnecessary or even harmful for close-knit OHCs. Similarly, members' perceptions of moderator roles are underexplored. Starting January of 2013, WebMD moderators stopped working for WebMD communities. This event provided an opportunity for us to study the perceived role of moderators in OHCs. Objective: We examine the OHC members' perception on OHC moderators by studying their reactions toward the departure of moderators in their communities. We also analyzed the relative posting activity on OHCs before and after the departure of moderators from the communities among all members and those who discussed moderators' departures. Methods: We applied a mixed-methods approach to study the posts of all 55 moderated WebMD communities by querying the terms relating to discussions surrounding moderators' disappearance from the WebMD community. We performed open and axial coding and affinity diagramming to thematically analyze patients' reactions to the disappeared moderators. The number of posts and poster groups (members and moderators) were analyzed over time to understand posting patterns around moderators' departure. Results: Of 821 posts retrieved under 95 threads, a total of 166 open codes were generated. The codes were then grouped into 2 main themes with 6 total subthemes. First, patients attempted to understand why moderators had left and what could be done to fill the void left by the missing moderators. During these discussions, the posts revealed that patients believed that moderators played critical roles in the communities by making the communities vibrant and healthy, finding solutions, and giving medical information. Some patients felt personally attached with moderators, expressing they would cease their community participation. On the other hand, patients also indicated that moderators were not useful or sometimes even harmful for peer interactions. The overall communities' posting activity, which was already in decline, showed no significant difference before and after the moderators' departure. In fact, the overall posting activities of the communities were declining well before the moderators' departure. These declining posting activities might be the reason why WebMD removed the moderators. Conclusion: Compassionate moderators who provide medical expertise, control destructive member posts, and help answer questions can provide important support for patient engagement in OHCs. Moderators are in general received positively by community members and do not appear to interfere with peer interactions. Members are well aware of the possibility of misinformation spreading in OHCs. Further investigation into the attitudes of less vocal community members should be conducted.

AB  - We investigated the effect of beta-adrenergic stimulation on the heart rate and QT interval in syncope children with or without coexisting ventricular arrhythmias (VA). Of the 24 children who presented with syncope or presyncope and showed negative tilt test, 13 were classified into a group with VA and the remaining 11 without VA. The provocative test was performed in bolus infusion and continuous infusion. RR, QT, and QTc intervals on routine 12-lead surface electrocardiogram were obtained during each stage of isoproterenol infusion. In all cases, malignant ventricular arrhythmia and syncope were not induced by isoproterenol provocative test. RR and QT intervals were shortened and QTc intervals were prolonged as the isoproterenol dose was increased in both groups and methods. The QTc interval reached its peak level after the bolus injection of 1.0 microgram and during the continuous infusion of 0.03 microgram/kg/min. The two groups showed no significant difference in the QTc interval change according to the infusion methods. This study indicates that changes in the heart rate and QT interval by beta-adrenergic stimulation were not different according to the coexisting ventricular arrhythmias in syncope children with negative head-up tilt test.

AB  - Many patients visit online health communities to receive support. In face-to-face support groups, health professionals facilitate peer-patients exchanging experience while adding their clinical expertise when necessary. However, the large scale of online health communities makes it challenging for such health professional moderators' involvement to happen. To address this challenge of delivering clinical expertise to where patients need them, we explore the idea of semi-automatically providing clinical expertise in online health communities. We interviewed 14 clinicians showing them example peer-patient conversation threads. From the interviews, we examined the ideal practice of clinicians providing expertise to patients. The clinicians continuously assessed when peer-patients were providing appropriate support, what kinds of clinical help they could give online, and when to defer to patients' healthcare providers. The findings inform requirements for building a semi-automated system delivering clinical expertise in online health communities.

AB  - We investigate the effect of teenage driving on mortality and risky behaviors in the United States using a regression discontinuity design. We estimate that total mortality rises by 5.84 deaths per 100,000 (15 percent) at the minimum legal driving age cutoff, driven by an increase in motor vehicle fatalities of 4.92 deaths per 100,000 (44 percent). We also find that poisoning deaths, which are caused primarily by drug overdoses, rise by 0.31 deaths per 100,000 (29 percent) at the cutoff and that this effect is concentrated among females. Our findings show that teenage driving contributes to sex differences in risky drug use behaviors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Corticosteroid injection is beneficial in treating carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) due to its anti-inflammatory effects. However, its side effects limit widespread usage. Recently, several studies have found that polydeoxyribonucleotide offers anti-inflammatory capabilities with fewer side effects, making it an ideal alternative. Nevertheless, there has been no study on its effectiveness in patients with CTS. Therefore, we evaluate the effectiveness of polydeoxyribonucleotide in patients with CTS. Based on the criteria, 30 patients with CTS who received two-consecutive polydeoxyribonucleotide injections (with a week interval) were initially included. METHOD: Patients with CTS were investigated retrospectively. To evaluate the effectiveness of polydeoxyribonucleotide in patients with CTS, numeric rating scale (NRS), cross-sectional area (CSA) of the median nerve, and severity and functional status scores of CTS based on the Boston Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Questionnaire (BCTQ) were assessed. RESULTS: There was a significant improvement in the NRS, CSA, and functional and severity scores of BCTQ after two-consecutive polydeoxyribonucleotide injections (P < .05). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, although more research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of polydeoxyribonucleotide in patients with CTS, the findings here suggest that polydeoxyribonucleotide may be a viable alternative to corticosteroids in patients with CTS.

AB  - Specialty cigarettes, bidis and kreteks, have commonly been viewed by adolescent users as being less harmful than conventional cigarettes. Biochemical studies, however, have shown that the concentration and delivery of nicotine from these tobacco products are not insignificant. The current study tested whether the diagnosis and symptoms for nicotine dependence differed among conventional-only smokers (n=16 959), specialty-only smokers (n=313), and poly-tobacco smokers (n=1288) from the 2002 and 2003 National Surveys on Drug Use and Health. Compared with the specialty-only smokers, the conventional-only and poly-tobacco smokers were more dependent on nicotine, assessed by the Nicotine Dependence Syndrome Scale and a single item from the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence. However, after accounting for differences in smoking frequency, the specialty-only smokers had significantly greater odds of being nicotine dependent than the conventional-only smokers. The reversed effect was primarily attributed to the specialty-only smokers who smoked less frequently, but reported a shorter time to their first cigarette. These findings suggest that the nicotine acquired from specialty cigarettes may be sufficient in yielding a sense of urgency to smoke.

AB  - AIM OF THIS STUDY: Many cartilage protective agents have been developed from natural products, and they have resulted in the development of treatments for osteoarthritis. In this study, we determined the osteoarthritic efficacy and mechanism of butanol fraction from the bark of Betula platyphylla var. japonica (BFBP) in collagenase-induced rabbit model of osteoarthritis (CIA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The right knees of rabbits were injected intra-articularly with collagenase, and rabbits were orally administrated with distilled water (vehicle), BFBP (50, 100 and 200 mg/kg) or celecoxib (100 mg/kg) once a day for 28 days after the initiation of the CIA. RESULTS: Oral administration of BFBP dose-dependently suppressed the stiffness and global histologic score. Proteoglycan intensity was considerably increased in a dose-dependent manner. As well, the mRNA expression of MMP-1, and MMP-3 was decreased. On the contrary, the level of TIMP-1 in the synovial fluids was significantly increased in the BFBP treated group. The pathologic inflammatory molecules such as PGE2 and COX-2 were inhibited by BFBP, but COX-1 expression not affected. CONCLUSION: We suggest that BFBP has shown the protective effect on cartilage alternations through balance of MMPs/TIMP-1 and regulates inflammatory-related molecules in vivo model of osteoarthritis, and great candidate for development of osteoarthritis treatment.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Traditional medicine has widely been used Betula platyphylla var. japonica to treat various inflammatory diseases including arthritis. AIM OF THE STUDY: To determine the anti-inflammatory, anti-nociceptive, and anti-arthritic effects of Betula platyphylla in interleukin-1β (IL-1β)-stimulated fibroblast-like synoviocytes from human rheumatoid arthritis and in nociceptive and inflammatory animal model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The inflammatory mediators such as IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1, MMP-13, inducible nitric oxide synthesis (iNOS), nitrites, prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) and cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX-2) activity of Betula platyphylla were tested in IL-1β-stimulated fibroblast-like synoviocytes. Tail withdrawal in response to thermal stimulation in tail flick test or paw flinching and shaking in response to sc hind paw formalin injection was measured 1h after oral administration of Betula platyphylla. The former was evaluated with a paw pressure test, and the latter was measured using the squeaking score, and paw volume in inflammatory arthritis tests. RESULTS: Betula platyphylla significantly inhibited proliferation of IL-1β-induced synoviocytes. Betula platyphylla reduced the levels of inflammatory mediators, such as IL-6, TNF-α, MMP-1, MMP13, and PGE(2). In particular, Betula platyphylla significantly inhibited the releases of nitrites and iNOS, as well as release of NFκB, into the nucleus of IL-1β-treated synoviocytes, even at concentrations as low as 1μg/ml. Oral administrant of Betula platyphylla at 400mg/kg significantly decreased about 27.8% of tail flick withdrawal and inhibited about the number of paw flinches in both phases 1 and 2 of the formalin test. In the carrageenan-induced acute pain and arthritis model, Betula platyphylla dose dependently reduced the nociceptive threshold and the arthritic symptoms at day 8, respectively, and Betula platyphylla at 400mg/kg markedly reduced the inflammatory area about 48% in the ankle joints. This capacity of Betula platyphylla at 400mg/kg was similar to that of the celecoxib-2 inhibitor in carrageenan-induced nociceptive and inflammatory arthritis model. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that Betula platyphylla has anti-nociceptive and anti-inflammatory effects in IL-1β-stimulated RA FLS and in an animal model of arthritis. Thus, the use of Betula platyphylla as a pharmaceutical candidate for the treatment of arthritis should be further studied.

AB  - Melittin (1) is a major polypeptide in honey bee venom that has been used traditionally against chronic inflammation and cancer. However, its molecular mechanism has not been determined. In this study, the antitumor effect of 1 was compared with that of NS398, a cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor, in vivo and in vitro. Subcutaneous injection of 1 at 0.5 and 5 mg/kg suppressed significantly vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A-transfected highly metastatic Lewis lung cancer (VEGF-A-hm LLC) tumor growth by 25% and 57%, respectively. Also, 1 inhibited significantly the number of vessels around VEGF-A-hm LLC cells. The results were superior to those obtained in the mice treated with NS398. Compound 1 dose-dependently inhibited proliferation and tube formation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (VEGF-A-HUVECs), without affecting cell viability in native HUVECs. In addition, 1 decreased the expression of VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2), COX-2, and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in VEGF-A-transfected HUVECs. These effects were accompanied by a reduction of the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and c-jun N-terminal kinase, whereas it increased the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). SB203580 abolished the downregulation of COX-2 and VEGFR-2 and the inhibition of cell proliferation by 1. The antitumor activity of 1 may be associated with antiangiogenic actions via inhibiting VEGFR-2 and inflammatory mediators involved in the MAPK signaling pathway.

AB  - Recent studies have revealed that 1,2,3,4,6-penta-O-galloyl-beta-d-glucose (PGG) has anti-tumorigenic activity in vitro. In the present work, we evaluated the in vitro and in vivo antiangiogenic and antitumor activities of PGG and examined its molecular mechanisms. PGG significantly inhibited the proliferation and tube formation in basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) at non-cytotoxic concentrations. PGG effectively disrupted the bFGF-induced neo-vascularization in chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) and in Matrigel plugs in the mice. When mice were intraperitoneally injected, PGG also significantly inhibited tumor angiogenesis induced by Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) and the growth of LLC by 57 and 91% of control tumor weight at 4 and 20 mg/kg, respectively. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed decreased microvessel density, decreased expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), reduced tumor cell proliferation and increased tumor cell apoptosis. Similarly, PGG significantly attenuated the expression of COX-2 and VEGF and reduced the secretion of VEGF and prostaglandin E2 in bFGF-treated HUVECs. Furthermore, the COX-2 inhibitor NS398 significantly inhibited tube formation and neo-vascularization in CAM, supporting the role of COX-2 in PGG inhibition of angiogenesis. PGG diminished the phosphorylation of extracellular signal regulated kinase 1/2, Jun NH2-terminal kinase and activated phospho-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in a dose-dependent manner in bFGF-treated HUVECs. In addition, p38 inhibitor SB203580 abolished the downregulation of COX-2, VEGF and the antiproliferative activity by PGG. Taken together, our data demonstrate that PGG exerts antitumor activity primarily via inhibition of angiogenesis through COX-2 and MAPK- dependent pathways.

AB  - Context • Pain from osteoarthritis is associated with peripheral nociception and central pain processing. Given the unmet need for innovative, effective, and well-tolerated therapies, many patients, after looking for more satisfactory alternatives, decide to use complementary and alternative modalities. The analgesic mechanism of subcutaneous injections of diluted bee venom into an acupoint is thought to be part of an anti-inflammatory effect and the central modulation of pain processing. Objectives • Using the rat model of collagenase-induced osteoarthritis (CIOA), the study intended to investigate the analgesic effects of bee venom acupuncture (BVA) as they are related to the acupuncture points and dosage used and to determine whether the analgesic mechanisms of BVA for pain were mediated by opioid or adrenergic receptors. Design • Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to one of 19 groups, with n = 10 for each group. Setting • The study was conducted at the East-West Bone and Joint Research Institute at Kyung Hee University (Seoul, South Korea). Intervention • All rats were intra-articularly injected with collagenase solution in the left knee, followed by a booster injection performed 4 d after the first injection. For the groups receiving BVA treatments, the treatment was administered into the ST-36 acupoint, except for 1 group that received the treatment into a nonacupoint. Three BVA intervention groups received no pretreatment with agonists or antagonists; 1 of them received a dose of 1 mg/kg of bee venom into acupoint ST-36, 1 received a dose of 2 mg/kg into acupoint ST-36, and 1 received a dose of 1 mg/kg into a nonacupoint location. For the intervention groups receiving pretreatments, the opioid-receptor or adrenergic-receptor agonists or antagonists were injected 20 min before the 1-mg/kg BVA treatments. Outcome Measures • Changes in the rats' pain thresholds were assessed by evaluation of pain-related behavior, using a tail flick latency unit. Results • The pain reached its maximum value after 4 wk of CIOA induction. The 1-mg/kg ST-36 BVA treatment resulted in a more significant analgesic effect than nonacupoint BVA. Pain-related behavior was more effectively improved by treatment with 1 mg/kg of BVA than with 2 mg/kg of BVA. The analgesic effects of the BVA were not synergistic with the agonist pretreatments with the μ-, δ-, or κ-opioid receptors or with the α1-, α2-, and β-adrenergic receptors. The analgesic effects of the BVA were not decreased by the antagonist pretreatments for the μ- or κ-opioid receptors or for the α1- or β-adrenergic receptors. The ST-36-BVA-induced analgesia was inhibited by the antagonist pretreatments for the δ-opioid receptor and the α2-adrenergic receptor. Conclusion • The ST-36 BVA treatment exerted an analgesic effect on CIOA-induced pain through the partial involvement of the δ-opioid and α2-adrenergic receptors.

AB  - Chronic diarrhea is one of the most frequent gastro-intestinal manifestations in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Protozoa and nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are opportunistic pathogens that can easily infect these patients. Among the NTM, Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) is the most frequently observed pathogen in HIV-infected patients. However, NTMs other than MAC have not been reported as a gastrointestinal pathogen as yet. We present a case of chronic diarrhea in an AIDS patient in whom Mycobacterium ulcerans and cryptosporidium co-infection is evidenced from colonic tissue.

AB  - Eukaryotic transcriptional activators may function, at least in part, to facilitate the assembly of the RNA polymerase II (pol II) preinitiation complex at the core promoter region through their interaction with a subset of components of the basal transcription machinery. Previous studies have shown that artificial tethering of TATA-binding protein (TBP) to the promoter region is sufficient to stimulate pol II transcription in yeast. To test whether this phenomenon is a general one in eukaryotic pol II transcription, the DNA-binding domain of yeast GAL4 was fused to either Xenopus laevis TBP or TFIIB in order to enable these factors to be efficiently positioned near the transcription start site in a GAL4-binding site-dependent manner. We found that GAL4-xTBP as well as GAL4-xTFIIB directed an increased level of transcription without involvement of the transcriptional activator, suggesting that incorporation of these basal factors into a preinitiation complex (PIC) is a major rate-limiting step accelerated by activator proteins in metazoans. These results show that transcription activation by artificial recruitment of basal transcription machinery can be observed in general among eukaryotic transcription both in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, failure of recovery of transcription by adding GAL4-xTFIIB after depletion of endogenous TBP with TATA oligo competitor suggests that recruitment of TBP cannot be bypassed for Pol II transcription.

AB  - Short periods of testosterone suppression have been shown to reduce trabecular smooth muscle content and increase interstitial connective tissue accumulation in animal models. However, the long-term effects of testosterone suppression remain unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term effects of testosterone suppression on penile structure and erectile function in rats. Subjects were divided into two groups by observation period (short-period group (group I), 12 weeks; long-period group (group II), 20 weeks). Each group comprised three different subgroups (10 rats each): sham-operated control, surgical castration, and testosterone replacement (4 weeks after an 8-week castration period). Group II subgroups included a sham control, surgical castration, and testosterone replacement (4 weeks after a 16-week castration period). Erectile function was assessed by measuring intracavernosal pressure in response to cavernous nerve stimulation, and expression of the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) protein was determined by western blot analysis. Serum testosterone values were measured via radioimmunoassay. The results indicated that serum testosterone level, penile length and girth, cavernosal smooth muscle content, and eNOS activity decreased significantly in castrated animals. These effects were rescued by testosterone undecanoate injection. Erectile function was normalized over 4 weeks in rats that received androgen replacement. Expression of eNOS was decreased in the corpus cavernosum of castrated animals compared with controls, while androgen replacement normalized the expression of eNOS. These results were consistently observed regardless of the duration of androgen deprivation. Thus, these data suggest that androgen regulates the expression of eNOS in the rat penile corpus cavernosum and confirm the importance of androgens in the maintenance of erectile function. Additionally, long-term androgen deprivation does not induce irreversible structural or erectile functional changes in sexually mature adult male rats.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is characterized by a progressive increase in pulmonary vascular resistance and elevation of pulmonary arterial pressure, leading to right ventricular failure and eventual death. Currently, no curative therapy for PAH is available, and the overall prognosis is very poor. Recently, direct activators of soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) have been tested as a novel therapeutic modality in experimental models of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). OBJECTIVE: In this study, we used in vitro and in vivo models to evaluate the therapeutic potential of 3-(5'-hydroxymethyl-2'-furyl)-1-benzylindazole (YC-1), a dual functioning chemical, as a direct activator of guanylyl cyclase and an inhibitor of hypoxia-inducible factor-1. METHODS: We analyzed the effects of YC-1 on cell proliferation and the levels of p21 and p53 in human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (HPASMCs) under hypoxia. We also determined the effects of YC-1 on expression of endothelin-1 (ET-1) and phosphorylation status of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) at Ser(1179) in human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAECs) under hypoxia. In mice, hypoxic PAH was induced by exposure to normobaric hypoxic conditions for 28 days. To assess preventive or therapeutic effects, randomized mice were subjected to once daily i.p. injections of YC-1 for the entire hypoxic period (5 mg/kg) or for the last seven days of a 28-day hypoxic period (5 and 10 mg/kg). On day 28, we measured the right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) and determined the degrees of right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) and vascular remodeling. RESULTS: In HPASMCs, YC-1 inhibited hypoxia-induced proliferation and induction of p53 and p21 in a concentration-dependent manner. Also, YC-1 suppressed the hypoxia-induced expression of ET-1 mRNA and dephosphorylation of eNOS at Ser(1179) in HPAECs. In the preventive in vivo model, a daily dose of 5 mg/kg YC-1 significantly prevented the elevation of RVSP, development of RVH, and pulmonary vascular remodeling, which were caused by hypoxic exposure. In the therapeutic model, YC-1 at daily doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg alleviated RVH and pulmonary vascular remodeling but did not prevent the elevation of RVSP. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that YC-1 prevents the development of hypoxia-induced PAH in a preventive model and alleviates RVH and pulmonary vascular remodeling in a therapeutic model. Therefore, these data imply that YC-1 has therapeutic potential for use in a single or combination therapy for PAH.

AB  - Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) play an important role in diabetes complications, including diabetic nephropathy (DN). Plasma free fatty acids (FFAs) as well as glucose are increased in diabetes, and peroxisomes and mitochondria participate in FFA oxidation in an interconnected fashion. Therefore, we investigated whether deficiency of catalase, a major peroxisomal antioxidant, accelerates DN through peroxisomal dysfunction and abnormal renal FFA metabolism. Diabetes was induced by multiple injections of low-dose streptozotocin into catalase knock-out (CKO) and wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice. Murine mesangial cells (MMCs) transfected with catalase small interfering RNA followed by catalase overexpression were used to further elucidate the role of endogenous catalase. Despite equivalent hyperglycemia, parameters of DN, along with markers of oxidative stress, were more accelerated in diabetic CKO mice than in diabetic WT mice up to 10 weeks of diabetes. CKO mice and MMCs showed impaired peroxisomal/mitochondrial biogenesis and FFA oxidation. Catalase deficiency increased mitochondrial ROS and fibronectin expression in response to FFAs, which were effectively restored by catalase overexpression or N-acetylcysteine. These data provide unprecedented evidence that FFA-induced peroxisomal dysfunction exacerbates DN and that endogenous catalase plays an important role in protecting the kidney from diabetic stress through maintaining peroxisomal and mitochondrial fitness.

AB  - Social science and public health literature has framed residential segregation as a potent structural determinant of the higher HIV burden among black heterosexuals, but empirical evidence has been limited. The purpose of this study is to test, for the first time, the association between racial segregation and newly diagnosed heterosexually acquired HIV cases among black adults and adolescents in 95 large US metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) in 2008-2015. We operationalized racial segregation (the main exposure) using Massey and Denton's isolation index for black residents; the outcome was the rate of newly diagnosed HIV cases per 10,000 black adult heterosexuals. We tested the relationship of segregation to this outcome using multilevel multivariate models of longitudinal (2008-2015) MSA-level data, controlling for potential confounders and time. All covariates were lagged by 1 year and centered on baseline values. We preliminarily explored mediation of the focal relationship by inequalities in education, employment, and poverty rates. Segregation was positively associated with the outcome: a one standard deviation decrease in baseline isolation was associated with a 16.2% reduction in the rate of new HIV diagnoses; one standard deviation reduction in isolation over time was associated with 4.6% decrease in the outcome. Exploratory mediation analyses suggest that black/white socioeconomic inequality may mediate the relationship between segregation and HIV. Our study suggests that residential segregation may be a distal determinant of HIV among black heterosexuals. The findings further emphasize the need to address segregation as part of a comprehensive strategy to reduce racial inequities in HIV.

AB  - PURPOSE: To assess cross-population linkages in HIV/AIDS epidemics, we tested the hypothesis that the number of newly diagnosed AIDS cases among Black people who inject drugs (PWID) was positively related to the natural log of the rate of newly diagnosed HIV infections among Black non-PWID heterosexuals in 84 large U.S. metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) in 2008-2016. METHODS: We estimated a multilevel model centering the time-varying continuous exposures at baseline between the independent (Black PWID AIDS rates) and dependent (HIV diagnoses rate among Black heterosexuals) variables. RESULTS: At MSA level, baseline (standardized β = 0.12) Black PWID AIDS rates and change in these rates over time (standardized β = 0.11) were positively associated with the log of new HIV diagnoses rates among Black heterosexuals. Thus, MSAs with Black PWID AIDS rates that were 1 standard deviation= higher at baseline also had rates of newly diagnosed HIV infections among Black non-PWID heterosexuals that were 10.3% higher. A 1 standard deviation increase in independent variable over time corresponded to a 7.8% increase in dependent variable. CONCLUSIONS: Black PWID AIDS rates may predict HIV rates among non-PWID Black heterosexuals. Effective HIV programming may be predicated, in part, on addressing intertwining of HIV epidemics across populations.

AB  - PURPOSE: To compare baseline demographic, systemic, and ocular characteristics within age and racial subgroups among participants in this Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network clinical trial and to compare this cohort with other cohorts enrolled in phase 3 clinical trials for diabetic retinopathy. METHODS: Thirty-six month, randomized, controlled, multicenter clinical trial of 693 participants with diabetic macular edema enrolled at 88 clinical sites in the United States. Participants were categorized into self-reported race/ethnicity subgroups and into one of three age groups: 18 to <60, 60 to <70, and 70 and older. RESULTS: Mean age of participants was 63 years, 72% were white, and median visual acuity letter score was 62 (approximately 20/63). No substantial difference was identified between racial subgroups for any baseline variable. Older participants were more likely to have Type 2 diabetes mellitus and longer duration disease. The most frequent levels of diabetic retinopathy among 840 study eyes were moderate (level 43) to moderately severe (level 47) nonproliferative disease. CONCLUSION: While the racial composition of this cohort does not differ from other cohorts in large phase 3 trials that have evaluated participants with diabetic retinopathy, the inclusion of many subjects over age 70 and a better level of glycemic control are distinguishing features.

AB  - Our overall goal is to understand how viral envelope proteins mediate membrane fusion and pathogenesis. Membrane fusion is a crucial step in the delivery of the viral genome into the cell resulting in infection. On the other hand, fusion activity of viral envelope glycoproteins expressed in infected cells may cause the demise of uninfected bystander cells by apoptosis. Our general approach is to kinetically resolve steps in the pathway of viral envelope glycoprotein-mediated membrane fusion and to uncover physical parameters underlying those steps using a variety of biochemical, biophysical, virological, and molecular and cell biological techniques. Since HIV fusion involves a complex cascade of interactions of the envelope glycoprotein with two receptors, membrane organization plays an important role and interfering with it may modulate entry. To study this phenomenon, we have either examined cell lines with differential expression of sphingolipids (such as GM3), or altered membrane organization by modifying levels of cholesterol, ceramides, or glycosphingolipids. We show that the localized plasma membrane lipid microenvironment (and not the specific membrane lipids) in the vicinity of CD4 controls receptor mobility and HIV-1 fusion. The complex cascade of conformational changes that must occur to allow virus entry is also a very important target for therapy and vaccine development. We have recently designed and tested peptide analogs composed of chemical spacers and reactive moieties positioned strategically to promote permanent attachment. Using a temperature-arrested state in vitro assay we show evidence for the trapping of a pre-six-helix bundle fusion intermediate by a covalent reaction with the inhibitory reactive peptide. Also, using photo-reactive hydrophobic probes we have found ways to inactivate viral envelope glycoproteins while leaving their overall structures intact. Finally, in order to study the envelope glycoprotein effects on pathogenesis, we have used an in vitro model of co-culture of envelope-expressing cells as effectors and CD4+ T cells as targets. We delineated that apoptosis mediated by envelope glycoprotein in bystander cells correlates with transmembrane subunit (gp41)-induced hemifusion. The apoptotic pathway initiated by this interaction involves caspase-3-dependent mitochondrial depolarization and reactive oxygen species production, which depends on the phenotype of the envelope glycoprotein associated with the virus. Taken as a whole, our studies have many different important implications for antiviral therapies and vaccine development.

AB  - Peptide inhibitors corresponding to sequences in the six helix bundle structure of the fusogenic portion (gp41) of the HIV envelope glycoprotein have been successfully implemented in preventing HIV entry. These peptides bind to regions in HIV gp41 transiently exposed during the fusion reaction. In an effort to improve upon these entry inhibitors, we have successfully designed and tested peptide analogs composed of chemical spacers and reactive moieties positioned strategically to facilitate covalent attachment. Using a temperature-arrested state prime wash in vitro assay we show evidence for the trapping of a pre-six helix bundle fusion intermediate by a covalent reaction with the specific anti-HIV-1 peptide. This is the first demonstration of the trapping of an intermediate conformation of a viral envelope glycoprotein during the fusion process that occurs in live cells. The permanent specific attachment of the covalent inhibitor is projected to improve the pharmacokinetics of administration in vivo and thereby improve the long-term sustainability of peptide entry inhibitor therapy and help to expand its applicability beyond salvage therapy.

AB  - In this work we have developed specific inhibitors of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase by targeting the RNA/DNA duplex that is a principal substrate of the enzyme. To accomplish this, we have developed what we are calling the "weak intercalator" approach, wherein we attempt to simultaneously bind multiple weak intercalators to critical polymerase nucleic acids. We define weak intercalators as planar sp(2) hybridized molecules with only two cycles, that have poor binding affinity individually and can only bind with high affinity if two or more weak intercalation events can take place. Using this approach, we have identified linear and cyclic molecules that present two weak intercalators that can inhibit HIV-1-RT 50 to 100 times more effectively than single weak intercalators. Specifically, a cyclic peptide motif that presents two quinoxaline rings inhibits HIV-1-RT at low µM concentration, shows no inhibition of DNA polymerase and in addition maintains a majority of its inhibitory power in the presence of 90,000 fold excess duplex DNA. These results suggest that the weak intercalator approach may prove effective as a way of targeting increasingly complex nucleic acid structures in a highly specific manner.

AB  - Reactive oxygen species (ROS) activate retinoid-containing quiescent hepatic stellate cells (qHSCs) to retinoid-deficient fibrogenic myofibroblast-like cells (aHSCs). However, ROS also cause apoptosis of aHSCs, and apoptotic aHSCs are observed in inflammatory fibrotic liver. Here, we investigated mechanisms of the effects of oxidative stress on the survival of qHSCs and aHSCs. HSCs from normal rat liver were used after overnight culture (qHSCs), or in 3-5 passages (aHSCs). For in vivo induction of oxidative stress, tert-butylhydroperoxide was injected into control and CCl4-induced cirrhotic rats. Spontaneous caspase-3 activation and apoptosis, observed in cultured qHSCs, decreased with time and were unaffected by superoxide. In contrast, superoxide caused caspase-3 and p38-MAPK activation, reduction in Bcl-xL expression, and apoptosis in aHSCs. Inhibition of caspase-3 and p38-MAPK did not affect the viability of qHSCs in the absence or presence of superoxide, but inhibited superoxide-induced death of aHSCs. Glutathione (GSH) level and activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were lower in aHSCs than qHSCs. Superoxide increased GSH content, and activities of SOD, catalase and GPx in qHSCs but not in aHSCs. Incubation of 13-cis-retinoic acid (RA)-treated aHSCs with superoxide increased their GSH content significantly, and prevented superoxide-induced p38-MAPK and caspase-3 activation while dramatically reducing the extent of apoptosis. Finally, oxidative stress induced in vivo caused apoptosis of aHSCs in cirrhotic but not of qHSCs in control rats. These results suggest that the absence of retinoids render aHSCs susceptible to superoxide-induced apoptosis via caspase-3 and p38-MAPK activation.

AB  - Objectives: To identify factors associated with effective AIDS behavior change Design: Cross-sectional surveys of IDU, with determination of HIV status. Trends in city HIV seroprevalence among IDU also used to validate effectiveness of behavior change. Setting and participants: Subjects recruited from drug-use treatment programs and outreach efforts in Bangkok, Thailand (n=601), Glasgow, Scotland (n=919), New York City, USA (n=2539), and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (n=466). Results: Evidence for the effectiveness of self-reported risk reduction was available for all cities. Univariate followed by multiple logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with self-reported AIDS behavior change. Separate analyses were conducted for each city. Talking about AIDS with drug-using friends was significantly associated with behavior change in all four cities. Talking with sex partners about AIDS, educational level, knowing that someone can be HIV-infected and still look healthy, and having been tested previously for HIV were each significantly associated with behavior change in three of the four cities. Conclusions: Despite the substantial differences in these national settings, there were common factors associated with effective risk reduction. In particular, risk reduction appears to occur through social processes rather than through individual attitude change. HIV prevention programs need to explicitly incorporate social processes into their work.

AB  - Recent cases of ''AIDS-like'' CD4 lymphocytopenia in the absence of HIV infection have generated considerable scientific and public interest. We studied CD4 cell counts and percentages from 1984 to 1992 among 1,246 HIV-seronegative injecting drug users in New York City, a population at very high risk for exposure to bloodborne pathogens. Severe CD4 lymphocytopenia was rare, and there was no evidence of an increase over time. Of 229 subjects with longitudinal data, only four met the surveillance definition for ''idiopathic CD4 lymphocytopenia'' (ICL). CD4 cell counts of <500 cells/mul were, however, associated with subsequent HIV seroconversion (12.7/100 person-years at risk, relative risk (RR) = 4.53, 95% exact binomial confidence interval (CI) 1.7-10.7, p = 0.002).

AB  - Objectives.-To examine trends in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) risk behavior and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seroprevalence among injecting drug users (IDUs) in New York City from 1984 through 1992. Design and Setting.-Comparisons were made between two surveys of IDUs at the same hospital-based New York City drug abuse detoxification program: 141 IDUs in 1984 and 974 IDUs in 1990 through 1992. National Death Registry, New York City Health Department, and drug treatment program records were also used. Participants.-Persons attending detoxification program randomly selected for participation. Eligibility was based on injection within previous 2 months; 99% acceptance rates were obtained. Participants in the 1984 and 1990 through 1992 surveys were 66% and 79% men, 21% and 19% white, 33% and 34% African American, and 45% and 46% Latin American, respectively. Interventions.-Community-based AIDS prevention programs, including underground syringe exchanges. Main Outcome Measures.-Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome risk behaviors; HIV serostatus; CD4+ cell counts; death rates among 1984 subjects; and injection and intranasal routes of drug administration. Results.-The HIV seroprevalence remained stable at slightly more than 50%. Mean CD4+ cell counts declined from 0.716x10(9)/L (716/muL) to 0.575x10(9)/L (P<.009). Annual death rate among 1984 subjects was 3%, with a significantly higher rate among HIV-seropositive subjects (relative risk, 2.57; 95% exact binomial confidence interval, 1.12 to 6.61). Large-scale declines were observed in AIDS risk behaviors, eg, use of potentially contaminated syringes declined from 51% to 7% of injections (P<.001). Recent additional risk reduction was associated with use of the underground syringe exchanges. Intranasal heroin use was the primary route of drug administration for 46% of heroin admissions to New York City drug treatment programs. Conclusions.-The HIV seroprevalence has remained stable among this population of New York City IDUs for almost a decade. Continuation of current trends should lead to further reduction in HIV transmission, although reversal of the trend to intranasal use could lead to substantially increased transmission.

AB  - One third of all cases of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in the United States are associated with the injection of illicit drugs. There is mounting evidence for the effectiveness of syringe exchange programs in reducing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) risk behavior and HIV transmission among injection drug users. Expansion of syringe exchange would require increased public funding and undoubtedly would include government regulation of syringe exchanges. An analogy is drawn with the present system of regulation of methadone maintenance treatment programs and possible regulation of syringe exchange programs. Specific recommendations are offered to reduce the likelihood of repeating the regulatory problems of methadone maintenance treatment in future regulation of syringe exchange programs.

AB  - The centers for Disease Control (CDC) has proposed revising the AIDS surveillance definition to include any HIV-seropositive person with a CD4 cell count of less than 200 cells per microliter. Based on a study of persons receiving treatment for HIV infection, this new definition would lead to an estimated 50% increase in the number of persons recognized as living with AIDS. Among 440 HIV-seropositive research subjects recruited from drug treatment programs and through street out-reach in New York City, 59 met this definition, yet only 25% of those had been reported to the New York City AIDS registry. The new definition, if combined with HIV and T-cell testing at drug treatment and street outreach programs, could thus yield very large increases in the number of injecting drug users meeting the new surveillance definition of AIDS.

AB  - The N-terminal fusion domain of the HIV-1 gp41 envelope glycoprotein is responsible for initiating the fusion of viral and cellular membranes, leading to the subsequent infection of the host cell by HIV-1. We have investigated the backbone structure and dynamics of the 30 N-terminal residues of HIV-1 gp41 in membrane-mimicking environments using NMR spectroscopy and (15)N- and (15)N,(13)C,(2)H-labeled peptides. Similar (15)N-(1)H HSQC spectra were obtained in a variety of detergents, including SDS, DPC, mixed DPC/SDS, and LPPG micelles, indicating that the peptide structure is not strongly influenced by the type of detergent used. Detailed characterization was carried out in SDS micelles, where the long-term sample stability was found to be optimal. In addition to J-coupling and NOE restraints, a nearly complete set of backbone residual dipolar coupling restraints was recorded for the fusion domain-micelle complex aligned with respect to the magnetic field using a stretched polyacrylamide gel. Backbone amide (15)N spin relaxation and amide hydrogen exchange rates with the solvent were also measured. The ensemble of NMR structures reveals an uninterrupted alpha-helix for the least mobile residues (S(2) > 0.65), Ile-4 to Met-19, with transient helical character extending up to Ala-22. A 12-residue (Ile-4 to Ala-15) segment is fully shielded from solvent, with Gly-3 and Gly-16 found at micelle-solvent interfaces. Residues external to the micelle exhibit enhanced picosecond to nanosecond time scale dynamics relative to the residues buried in the micelle, and their mobility increases with the distance from the micelle.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The fruits of Schisandra chinensis (Trucz.) Baill. (Schisandraceae) which have been used as a tonic especially for kidney yin deficiency in Chinese traditional medicine are recently receiving attention for its preventive activity on age-related neurodegenerative diseases. A variety of studies demonstrated the cognitive-enhancing effects of Schisandra chinensis through animal tests and also in clinical trials. AIM OF STUDY: In this study, we attempted to investigate the effects of the lignan-riched extract of Schisandra chinensis fruits (ESP-806) on neurotoxicity and memory impairment induced by Aβ1-42 injection in mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The fruits of Schisandra chinensis were extracted with the mixture of n-hexane:ethanol (9:1), which is riched with bioactive dibenzocyclooctadiene lignans, schizandrin, gomisin N, wuweigisu C. After oral treatment of ESP-806 (100 mg/kg body weight) followed by injection of Aβ1-42 (2 μg/mouse, i.c.v.), novel object recognition and passive avoidance tests were evaluated. To verify the cognition enhancing effects of ESP-806, we examined the effects of ESP-806 on the activities of β-secretase and acetylcholinesterase, and the contents of Aβ and the reduced glutathione within the cortex and hippocampus of Aβ-injected mice. RESULTS: Oral treatment of ESP-806 (100 mg/kg body weight) significantly attenuated Aβ1-42-induced memory impairment evaluated by behavioral tests. Furthermore, the treatment of ESP-806 attenuated the elevation of β-secretase activity accompanying the reduced level of Aβ1-42 in the cortex and hippocampus of the brain. ESP-806 also significantly inhibited the acetylcholinesterase activity in the hippocampus and increased the content of the reduced glutathione in the cortex and hippocampus of mouse brain. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggested that the extract of Schisandra chinensis fruits riched with dibenzocyclooctadiene lignans may be useful in the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - We examined fusion mediated by the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and type 2 (HIV-2) envelope glycoproteins under various experimental conditions. Incubation of HeLa cells expressing HIV-2(ROD) and HIV-2(SBL/ISY) envelope glycoproteins with HeLa-CD4 target cells resulted in fusion at temperatures >/=25 degrees C whereas fusion with cells expressing HIV-1(Lai) occurred only at >/=31 degrees C. HIV-2 envelope glycoprotein-mediated fusion proceeded in the absence of Ca(2+) in the culture medium, whereas HIV-1 fusion required Ca(2+) ions for fusion. In contrast to HIV-2 envelope glycoprotein fusion, incubations in the presence of the 0.5 microM cytochalasin B completely inhibited HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein-mediated fusion. Our results suggest that in contrast to HIV-2, HIV-1 fusion is dependent on dynamic processes in the target membrane.

AB  - Drug and alcohol use have been associated with increased risk for sexual violence, but there is little research on sexual violence within the context of drug use among young adult opioid users. The current mixed-methods study explores young adult opioid users' sexual experiences in the context of their drug use. Forty-six New York City young adults (ages 18-32) who reported lifetime nonmedical use of prescription opioids (POs) completed in-depth, semistructured interviews, and 164 (ages 18-29) who reported heroin and/or nonmedical PO use in the past 30 days completed structured assessments that inquired about their drug use and sexual behavior and included questions specific to sexual violence. Participants reported frequent incidents of sexual violence experienced both personally and by their opioid using peers. Participants described sexual violence, including sexual assault, as occurring within a context characterized by victimization of users who were unconscious as a result of substance use, implicit and explicit exchanges of sex for drugs and/or money that increased risk for sexual violence, negative sexual perceptions ascribed to drug users, and participants' own internalized stigma. Recommendations to reduce sexual violence among young adult opioid users include education for users and service providers on the risk of involvement in sexual violence within drug using contexts and efforts to challenge perceptions of acceptability regarding sexual violence.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In eyes with diabetic macular edema, the relative efficacy of administering aflibercept monotherapy as compared with bevacizumab first with a switch to aflibercept if the eye condition does not improve sufficiently (a form of step therapy) is unclear. METHODS: At 54 clinical sites, we randomly assigned eyes in adults who had diabetic macular edema involving the macular center and a visual-acuity letter score of 24 to 69 (on a scale from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better visual acuity; Snellen equivalent, 20/320 to 20/50) to receive either 2.0 mg of intravitreous aflibercept or 1.25 mg of intravitreous bevacizumab. The drug was administered at randomization and thereafter according to the prespecified retreatment protocol. Beginning at 12 weeks, eyes in the bevacizumab-first group were switched to aflibercept therapy if protocol-specified criteria were met. The primary outcome was the mean change in visual acuity over the 2-year trial period. Retinal central subfield thickness and visual acuity at 2 years and safety were also assessed. RESULTS: A total of 312 eyes (in 270 adults) underwent randomization; 158 eyes were assigned to receive aflibercept monotherapy and 154 to receive bevacizumab first. Over the 2-year period, 70% of the eyes in the bevacizumab-first group were switched to aflibercept therapy. The mean improvement in visual acuity was 15.0 letters in the aflibercept-monotherapy group and 14.0 letters in the bevacizumab-first group (adjusted difference, 0.8 letters; 95% confidence interval, -0.9 to 2.5; P = 0.37). At 2 years, the mean changes in visual acuity and retinal central subfield thickness were similar in the two groups. Serious adverse events (in 52% of the patients in the aflibercept-monotherapy group and in 36% of those in the bevacizumab-first group) and hospitalizations for adverse events (in 48% and 32%, respectively) were more common in the aflibercept-monotherapy group. CONCLUSIONS: In this trial of treatment of moderate vision loss due to diabetic macular edema involving the center of the macula, we found no evidence of a significant difference in visual outcomes over a 2-year period between aflibercept monotherapy and treatment with bevacizumab first with a switch to aflibercept in the case of suboptimal response.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to investigate whether a multimodal analgesia (MMA) protocol reduces postoperative pain and opioids consumption in patients undergoing arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. METHODS: Fifty-four patients scheduled for arthroscopic rotator cuff repair were randomly assigned to either the MMA group or the control group. The primary outcome was visual analog scale (VAS) for pain. Secondary outcome measures included the time required for the VAS pain to reduce to that of a blood draw, (PCA) consumption, rescue morphine consumption, night awakening, and opioid-related side effects. RESULTS: The MMA group showed significantly less postoperative pain at postoperative 5 h, and 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. at 4th postoperative day (P < 0.001, = 0.040, and 0.013, respectively). MMA also shortened the time for postoperative pain to reduce down to the blood draw pain level from 5 days in the control group to 2 days in the MMA group. MMA also significantly reduced PCA consumption for up to 24 h postoperatively (P = 0.038) and rescue morphine consumption during the first 6 h and between 48 and 60 h postoperatively (P = 0.036 and 0.044, respectively). No significant differences were observed between the MMA and control groups with respect to side effects. CONCLUSION: The MMA protocol used in this study was found to reduce postoperative pain and opioid consumption during the acute postoperative period after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair without increasing side effects after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.

AB  - This study was undertaken to evaluate the effects of different rhBMP-2 release profiles in defect areas around dental implants on osseointegration and bone regeneration. Four beagle dogs (13-15 kg) were used. The defect was 3 mm deep and there was a 1 mm gap around the implant. Each of the four implants was installed on the right and left mandibular alveolar ridges. After the implants were placed, experimental groups were applied to the surrounding defect area (n = 8 in each group, the control group was not treated). The inject group was injected with rhBMP-2 solution directly. In the gel group, rhBMP-2 mixed with a hydrogel matrix was applied. In the particle-gel group, rhBMP-2-embedded poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)(PLGA) microparticles mixed with hydrogel matrix were applied to maintain consistent release. Sequential fluorescent labeling and histological analysis were performed to evaluate the new bone formation and osseointegration in the defect area. In the control group, larger marginal bone loss was detected as compared with the other groups (P  <  0.05). The gel group showed significantly higher levels of BIC in the buccal and lingual defect areas compared with the other groups (P  <  0.05). New-bone percentages in the inject and gel groups formed more new bone than in the particle-gel and control groups (P  <  0.05). Despite the limitations of this study, the use of only hydrogel, which allows early release of rhBMP-2 followed by consistent extended release, showed better bone formation and osseointegration than simple injection or PLGA microparticles with hydrogel matrix.

AB  - Large declines in HIV incidence have been reported since 2001, and scientific advances in HIV prevention provide strong hope to reduce incidence further. Now is the time to replace the quest for so-called silver bullets with a public health approach to combination prevention that understands that risk is not evenly distributed and that effective interventions can vary by risk profile. Different countries have different microepidemics, with very different levels of transmission and risk groups, changing over time. Therefore, focus should be on high-transmission geographies, people at highest risk for HIV, and the package of interventions that are most likely to have the largest effect in each different microepidemic. Building on the backbone of behaviour change, condom use, and medical male circumcision, as well as expanded use of antiretroviral drugs for infected people and pre-exposure prophylaxis for uninfected people at high risk of infection, it is now possible to consider the prospect of what would be one of the most remarkable achievements in the history of public health: reduction of HIV transmission from a pandemic to low-level endemicity.

AB  - Black sexual minority men (BSMM) and Black transgender women (BTW) are disproportionately impacted by HIV and incarceration in the United States. In-depth interviews (N=34) and ongoing thematic analysis guided by the Exploration Phase of the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment framework were conducted to uncover key themes focused on the awareness, acceptability, and early adoption of conventional (i.e., daily oral pill) and non-conventional forms of PrEP (i.e., long-acting injectable, e-prescription for pick up post release) among jail-involved BSMM and BTW in Chicago, Illinois and Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The majority of participants were cisgender BSMM (88%) and were enrolled in Chicago (65%). There was greater awareness, availability, and adoption of conventional PrEP and non-conventional PrEP e-prescription for pick up post release among Chicago participants compared with Baton Rouge participants. Participants were largely receptive to all three forms of PrEP and stated a high need for HIV prevention in jails and immediately following release. PrEP stigma emerged as a major barrier to conventional daily PrEP adoption while incarcerated; potential misuse (e.g., pill selling) as a potential barrier to PrEP eprescription; and needle aversion and added clinic time as potential barriers to longacting injectable (LAI)-PrEP. Participants indicated that PrEP e-prescription could help support continuity of care post release and highlighted reduced stigma, convenience, and longer-term HIV protection as benefits for LAI-PrEP. Study findings provided context-specific information to inform the implementation of future PrEP interventions for jail-involved BSMM and BTW in two highly HIV-impacted jurisdictions.

AB  - We have continuously measured CD4-induced conformational changes of cell surface-expressed human immunodeficiency virus type-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120-gp41 in situ using 4,4'-dianilino-1, 1'-binaphthyl-5,5'-disulfonic acid, a fluorescent probe that binds to hydrophobic groups. CD4-expressing human T cell lines induced significant and rapid conformational changes (<1 min delay) in gp120-gp41 from T cell-tropic strains, and little conformational changes in gp120-gp41 from macrophage-tropic strains, with equivalent levels of envelope expression. Conversely, CD4-expressing human macrophages induced significant and rapid conformational changes in gp120-gp41 from macrophage-tropic strains, and little conformational changes in gp120-gp41 from T cell-tropic strains. Thus, the conformational changes undergone by gp120-gp41, which lead to membrane fusion, are highly cooperative and require both receptor and co-receptor. We used a dye transfer assay to show that neither membrane lipid fusion or fusion pore formation can occur with host cells having different tropism from the envelope.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In syringe-mediated drug-sharing (backloading), injecting drug users (IDU) use their syringes to mix drugs and to give measured shares to other IDU by squirting drug solution into the syringes of other IDU. Backloading has been discussed as a potential HIV risk factor, but its role as an HIV transmission route has not been established empirically. METHODS: Six hundred and sixty IDU who had injected drugs in the previous 2 years were street-recruited from Bushwick, New York City through chain referral, tested for HIV antibody and interviewed about sexual and drug-risk behaviors. RESULTS: Receiving drugs via backloading in the previous 2 years was reported by 24.5% of the subjects. These subjects had significantly higher HIV seroprevalence than those who did not receive drugs by backloading (odds ratio, 2.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-3.1). Backloading remained positively and significantly associated with HIV seropositivity in stepwise logistic regression, and in a series of simultaneous logistic models controlling for sociodemographic variables and for sexual and drug risk variables. CONCLUSIONS: Backloading can be a route of HIV transmission among IDU and should be incorporated into risk-factor studies and HIV transmission modeling. Many IDU who avoid other high-risk drug-injection practices may overlook the risk of backloading. HIV prevention programs should warn IDU against syringe-mediated drug-sharing and work together to develop ways to avoid it.

AB  - Black men who have sex with men and women (BMSMW) are at increased HIV risk, but few efficacious interventions meet their unique needs. Three HIV prevention interventions were evaluated with a common protocol. Baseline data were pooled to describe sexual behavior involving transmission risk with male, female, and male-to-female transgender partners and identify factors associated with transmission risk. BMSMW from Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and Chicago who reported sexual risk and bisexual behavior in the past year were recruited via modified chain referral sampling and community recruitment. Baseline assessments were conducted via audio computer-assisted interview and sexual behaviors assessed over the past 3 months. From December 2010 to November 2012, 584 BMSMW were enrolled across the three cities. More than half (55%) were recruited by other participants. Overall, the mean age was 43 years. Seventy-five percent reported an annual income <$10,000 and selling sex was prevalent (31%). Three-quarters identified as bisexual. Thirty-nine percent were HIV-positive. Among HIV-positive participants, 46% reported sex without condoms with HIV-negative or unknown male partners and 45% with HIV-negative or unknown female partners. Overall, factors associated with sex without condoms included network size, education, income, sexual orientation identification, HIV status, exchange sex, homonegativity, and social support. Findings support the need for enhanced HIV prevention efforts for this population. Future studies should examine contextual factors in addition to individual risk behaviors to inform the development and implementation of promising strategies to prevent HIV and promote the overall health and wellness of BMSMW and their sexual partners.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The increased availability of high-throughput datasets has revealed a need for reproducible and accessible analyses which can quantitatively relate molecular changes to phenotypic behavior. Existing tools for quantitative analysis generally require expert knowledge. RESULTS: CellPD (cell phenotype digitizer) facilitates quantitative phenotype analysis, allowing users to fit mathematical models of cell population dynamics without specialized training. CellPD requires one input (a spreadsheet) and generates multiple outputs including parameter estimation reports, high-quality plots, and minable XML files. We validated CellPD's estimates by comparing it with a previously published tool (cellGrowth) and with Microsoft Excel's built-in functions. CellPD correctly estimates the net growth rate of cell cultures and is more robust to data sparsity than cellGrowth. When we tested CellPD's usability, biologists (without training in computational modeling) ran CellPD correctly on sample data within 30 min. To demonstrate CellPD's ability to aid in the analysis of high throughput data, we created a synthetic high content screening (HCS) data set, where a simulated cell line is exposed to two hypothetical drug compounds at several doses. CellPD correctly estimates the drug-dependent birth, death, and net growth rates. Furthermore, CellPD's estimates quantify and distinguish between the cytostatic and cytotoxic effects of both drugs-analyses that cannot readily be performed with spreadsheet software such as Microsoft Excel or without specialized computational expertise and programming environments. CONCLUSIONS: CellPD is an open source tool that can be used by scientists (with or without a background in computational or mathematical modeling) to quantify key aspects of cell phenotypes (such as cell cycle and death parameters). Early applications of CellPD may include drug effect quantification, functional analysis of gene knockout experiments, data quality control, minable big data generation, and integration of biological data with computational models.

AB  - The proteins found in cow milk have been reported to cause systemic inflammation. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is known to be involved in the development of several metabolic disorders including insulin resistance and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. However, the effect of thiazolidinediones (TZDs) on ER stress is still controversial. This is why we want to investigate in this study whether casein, which is the major protein in cow's milk, induces ER stress in the liver and whether rosiglitazone can attenuate these changes. Nine-week-old male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were separated into three groups: (1) vehicle treated; (2) daily subcutaneous injections of 1 mL 10% casein; (3) daily subcutaneous injection of 1 mL 10% casein and rosiglitazone 4 mg/[kg d]. After 6 weeks, body weight, food intake, glucose and lipid parameters, and serum AST/ALT levels were measured after an overnight fast. Real time RT-PCR and immunohistochemical staining for various ER stress markers were performed, and a TUNEL analysis was also performed. After 6 weeks, casein injection induced weight reduction, systemic inflammation, and hepatic dysfunction in SD rats. Casein injection increased both the gene and protein expression of ER stress markers in the liver and also caused hepatocyte apoptosis. Rosiglitazone treatment attenuated casein-induced systemic inflammation, ER stress, deteriorated liver function, and increased apoptosis. In conclusion, our results may provide further insight into the effects of casein on chronic inflammatory diseases, and to have a better understanding of the mechanism of the anti-inflammatory properties of rosiglitazone regardless of its hypoglycemic effect.

AB  - During the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) global pandemic, urgent strategies to alleviate shortages are required. Evaluation of the feasibility, practicality, and value of drug conservation strategies and therapeutic alternatives requires a collaborative approach at the provincial level. The Ontario COVID-19 ICU Drug Task Force was directed to create recommendations suggesting drug conservation strategies and therapeutic alternatives for essential drugs at risk of shortage in the intensive care unit during the COVID-19 pandemic. Recommendations were rapidly developed using a modified Delphi method and evaluated on their ease of implementation, feasibility, and supportive evidence. This article describes the recommendations for drug conservation strategies and therapeutic alternatives for drugs at risk of shortage that are commonly used in the care of critically ill patients. Recommendations are identified as preferred and secondary ones that might be less desirable. Although the impetus for generating this document was the COVID-19 pandemic, recommendations should also be applicable for mitigating drug shortages outside of a pandemic. Proposed provincial strategies for drug conservation and therapeutic alternatives may not all be appropriate for every institution. Local implementation will require consultation from end-users and hospital administrators. Competing equipment shortages and available resources should be considered when evaluating the appropriateness of each strategy.

AB  - Drug-using men who have sex with men (MSM) are at high risk of acquiring or transmitting HIV infection. Efforts to change behaviors in this population have been hampered by difficulties in recruiting drug-using MSM into behavioral interventions. This study sought to develop an effective strategy for recruiting drug-using MSM into behavioral interventions that consist of motivational interviewing alone or motivational interviewing plus contingency management. MSM were recruited through advertising and community outreach into groups to discuss party drugs, party burnout, and sexual behavior, with the intervention subsequently described and enrollment offered in the group setting. Many more eligible MSM responded to advertisements for the discussion groups than advertisements for the interventions, and 58% of those who participated in the discussion groups volunteered for counseling. Men who entered counseling reported high levels of drug use and sexual activity and were racially and ethnically diverse; only 35% were willing to accept drug treatment. Results demonstrate that a two-stage strategy in which drug-using MSM are first recruited into discussion groups before they are offered a behavioral intervention can be an effective way to induce voluntary acceptance of an intervention employing a behavioral risk-reduction approach.

AB  - Background: We present a small longitudinal study of how demographic factors and persistent burdens of HIV and cytomegalovirus (CMV) influence cardiovascular health in young adults beginning ART in an inner-city clinic in Jakarta, Indonesia. Methods: ART-naive HIV patients [n = 67; aged 31 (19 to 48) years] were enrolled in the JakCCANDO Project. Echocardiography and carotid Doppler ultrasonography were performed before ART (V0) and after 3, 6, and 12 months (V3-12). Antibodies reactive with CMV lysate or IE-1 protein were assessed at each timepoint and CMV DNA was identified at V0. Results: Markers of adverse cardiovascular prognosis [left ventricular mass index, ejection fraction and carotid intimal media thickness (cIMT)] were similar to healthy controls, but increased at V12. Internal diameters of the carotid arteries and systolic blood pressure correlated with HIV disease severity at V0, but cardiac parameters and cIMT did not. E/A ratios (left ventricular diastolic function) were lower in patients with CMV DNA at V0, but this effect waned by V6. Levels of antibody reactive with CMV IE-1 correlated inversely with CD4 T cell counts at V0, and levels at V6-V12 correlated directly with the right cIMT. Conclusions: Overall the severity of HIV disease and the response to ART have only subtle effects on cardiovascular health in this young Asian population. CMV replication before ART may have a transient effect on cardiac health, whilst antibody reactive with CMV IE-1 may mark a high persistent CMV burden with cumulative effects on the carotid artery.

AB  - Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an effective yet under-utilised method for preventing HIV transmission in high-risk groups. Despite ongoing social marketing to increase PrEP awareness, few studies have evaluated public responses. This paper contextualises negative responses to Chicago's PrEP4Love campaign. In February 2016, a sex-positive ad campaign called PrEP4Love was launched online and throughout public spaces in Chicago. A gender and sexuality inclusive campaign, PrEP4Love is intended to be culturally responsive and sex positive, while retaining a focus on risk reduction. Advertisements prominently feature Black sexual minority men, and Black transgender women, and were strategically placed in diverse Chicago neighbourhoods. In response, there were 212 new callers to the PrEPLine during the two-month study period. Negative responses were concerned with: negatively depicting Black homosexuality (4), general anti-LGBTQ comments (7), adverse effects on children (6), sexually explicit nature (5), and general stigmatisation of racial minorities (4). Discussion focuses on sex-positive frameworks, normalising intimacy, stigma and historical mistrust of medical and pharmaceutical institutions, and the social meanings of biomedical prevention technologies (e.g. PrEP) in relation to dominant norms of sexuality and gender. This study is the first to investigate public responses to a sex-positive PrEP campaign. More studies of PrEP social marketing are needed to evaluate targeted public health campaigns to guide future PrEP promotion strategies.

AB  - Black sexual minority men (BSMM) in the USA navigate a range of factors that may influence the extent to which they disclose or conceal their sexual identity in various social contexts. To date, few studies have investigated the correlates of sexual identity disclosure or concealment among BSMM across multiple life domains. Guided by a minority stress perspective and intersectionality, we analyzed data from N = 809 BSMM who participated in the Social Justice Sexuality Survey. We conducted ordinary least squares regression to examine the relative weight of perceptions of homophobia, religiosity, LGBT community connectedness, racial identity salience, and sexual identity salience on disclosure of sexual identity in six social-relational contexts: (1) family, (2) friends, (3) neighbors, (4) religious community, (5) work, and (6) online. Findings indicate that BSMM disclosed their sexual identity unevenly across social-relational contexts. Notably, LGBTQ community connectedness and sexual identity importance were consistent predictors of sexual identity disclosure across contexts. In contrast, perceptions of homophobia were not related to sexual identity disclosure, suggesting that other factors may be more salient for BSMM when deciding to disclose their sexual identity. Finally, bisexual men consistently reported lower levels of sexual identity disclosure relative to gay men in all six contexts. Study findings have important implications for future research on sexual identity disclosure with diverse samples of BSMM.

AB  - In 2001, Friedman et al. conjectured the existence of a "firewall effect" in which individuals who are infected with HIV, but remain in a state of low infectiousness, serve to prevent the virus from spreading. To evaluate this historical conjecture, we develop a new graph-theoretic measure that quantifies the extent to which Friedman's firewall hypothesis(FH)holds in a risk network. We compute this new measure across simulated trajectories of a stochastic discrete dynamical system that models a social network of 25,000 individuals engaging in risk acts over a period of 15 years. The model's parameters are based on analyses of data collected in prior studies of the real-world risk networks of people who inject drugs (PWID) in New York City. Analysis of system trajectories reveals the structural mechanisms by which individuals with mature HIV infections tend to partition the network into homogeneous clusters (with respect to infection status) and how uninfected clusters remain relatively stable (with respect to infection status) over long stretches of time. We confirm the spontaneous emergence of network firewalls in the system and reveal their structural role in the nonspreading of HIV.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advise repeat HIV testing for partners of HIV-infected persons; injection drug users and their sex partners; individuals with recent multiple partnerships and their sex partners; those involved in sex trade; and men who have sex with men. Additional social and behavioral variables may be useful for identifying priority populations. METHODS: We analyzed data collected during a social network study conducted in a Brooklyn, NY, neighborhood to identify social and behavioral characteristics of respondents (N = 343) involved in HIV-discordant, herpes simplex virus-2- discordant, and chlamydia-discordant partnerships. RESULTS: HIV partnership discordance was associated with injection drug use but was generally not associated with sexual behaviors including multiple partnerships and sex trade. herpes simplex virus-2 and chlamydia partnership discordance were associated with multiple partnerships, sex trade, and same sex partnership history. Additional correlates of sexually transmitted infection (STI)/HIV-discordant partnerships included older age (>or=25 years), noninjection drug use, and incarceration history. Analyses suggested that screening tools composed of CDC-recommended sexual risk and injection drug indicators plus indicators of older age, noninjection drug use, and incarceration were more effective in identifying STI/HIV priority populations than tools composed of CDC indicators alone. CONCLUSIONS: Screening tools that include social and behavioral indicators may improve STI/HIV case-finding effectiveness.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We examined the link between incarceration and sexually transmitted infection (STI), including HIV, from a social network perspective. METHODS: We used data collected during a social network study conducted in Brooklyn, NY (n = 343), to measure associations between incarceration and infection with herpes simplex virus-2, chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis or HIV and sex with an infected partner, adjusting for characteristics of respondents and their sex partners. RESULTS: Infection with an STI or HIV was associated with incarceration of less than 1 year (adjusted prevalence ratio [PR] = 1.33; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.01, 1.76) and 1 year or longer (adjusted PR = 1.37; 95% CI = 1.08, 1.74). Sex in the past 3 months with an infected partner was associated with sex in the past 3 months with 1 partner (adjusted PR = 1.42; 95% CI = 1.12, 1.79) and with 2 or more partners (adjusted PR = 1.85; 95% CI = 1.43, 2.38) who had ever been incarcerated. CONCLUSIONS: The results highlight the need for STI and HIV treatment and prevention for current and former prisoners and provide preliminary evidence to suggest that incarceration may influence STI and HIV, possibly because incarceration increases the risk of sex with infected partners.

AB  - African Americans face disproportionate sexually transmitted infection including HIV (STI/HIV), with those passing through a correctional facility at heightened risk. There is a need to identify modifiable STI/HIV risk factors among incarcerated African Americans. Project DISRUPT is a cohort study of incarcerated African American men recruited from September 2011 through January 2014 from prisons in North Carolina who were in committed partnerships with women at prison entry (N = 207). During the baseline (in-prison) study visit, participants responded to a risk behavior survey and provided a urine specimen, which was tested for STIs. Substantial proportions reported multiple partnerships (42 %), concurrent partnerships (33 %), and buying sex (11 %) in the 6 months before incarceration, and 9 % tested positive for an STI at baseline (chlamydia: 5.3 %, gonorrhea: 0.5 %, trichomoniasis: 4.9 %). Poverty and depression appeared to be strongly associated with sexual risk behaviors. Substance use was linked to prevalent STI, with binge drinking the strongest independent risk factor (adjusted odds ratio: 3.79, 95 % CI 1.19-12.04). There is a continued need for improved prison-based STI testing, treatment, and prevention education as well as mental health and substance use diagnosis.

AB  - Incarceration is strongly associated with post-release STI/HIV risk. One pathway linking incarceration and STI/HIV risk may be incarceration-related dissolution of protective network ties. Among African American men released from prison who were in committed partnerships with women at the time of incarceration (N = 207), we measured the association between committed partnership dissolution during incarceration and STI/HIV risk in the 4 weeks after release. Over one-quarter (28%) experienced incarceration-related partnership dissolution. In adjusted analyses, incarceration-related partnership dissolution was strongly associated with post-release binge drinking (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 4.2, 95% confidence interval (CI); 1.4-15.5). Those who experienced incarceration-related partnership dissolution were much more likely to engage in multiple/concurrent partnerships or sex trade defined as buying or selling sex (64%) than those who returned to the partner (12%; AOR 20.1, 95% CI 3.4-175.6). Policies that promote maintenance of relationships during incarceration may be important for protecting health.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Getting to Zero (GTZ) initiatives focus on expanding use of antiretroviral treatment (ART) and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to eliminate new HIV infections. Computational models help inform policies for implementation of ART and PrEP continuums. Such models, however, vary in their design, and may yield inconsistent predictions. Using multiple approaches can help assess the consistency in results obtained from varied modeling frameworks, and can inform optimal implementation strategies. METHODS: A study using three different modeling approaches is conducted. Two approaches use statistical time series analysis techniques that incorporate temporal HIV incidence data. A third approach uses stochastic stimulation, conducted using an agent-based network model (ABNM). All three approaches are used to project HIV incidence among a key population, young Black MSM (YBMSM), over the course of the GTZ implementation period (2016-2030). RESULTS: All three approaches suggest that simultaneously increasing PrEP and ART uptake is likely to be more effective than increasing only one, but increasing ART and PrEP by 20% points may not eliminate new HIV infections among YBMSM. The results further suggest that a 20% increase in ART is likely to be more effective than a 20% increase in PrEP. All three methods consistently project that increasing ART and PrEP by 30% simultaneously can help reach GTZ goals. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing PrEP and ART uptake by about 30% might be necessary to accomplish GTZ goals. Such scale-up may require addressing psychosocial and structural barriers to engagement in HIV and PrEP care continuums. ABNMs and other flexible modeling approaches can be extended to examine specific interventions that address these barriers and may provide important data to guide the successful intervention implementation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE(S): 'Getting to Zero' (GTZ) initiatives aim to eliminate new HIV infections over a projected time frame. Increased preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) uptake among populations with the highest HIV incidence, such as young Black MSM, is necessary to accomplish this aim. Agent-based network models (ABNMs) can help guide policymakers on strategies to increase PrEP uptake. DESIGN: Effective PrEP implementation requires a model that incorporates the dynamics of interventions and dynamic feedbacks across multiple levels including virus, host, behavior, networks, and population. ABNMs are a powerful tool to incorporate these processes. METHODS: An ABNM, designed for and parameterized using data for young Black MSM in Illinois, was used to compare the impact of PrEP initiation and retention interventions on HIV incidence after 10 years, consistent with GTZ timelines. Initiation interventions selected individuals in serodiscordant partnerships, or in critical sexual network positions, and compared with a controlled setting where PrEP initiators were randomly selected. Retention interventions increased the mean duration of PrEP use. A combination intervention modeled concurrent increases in PrEP initiation and retention. RESULTS: Selecting HIV-negative individuals for PrEP initiation in serodiscordant partnerships resulted in the largest HIV incidence declines, relative to other interventions. For a given PrEP uptake level, distributing effort between increasing PrEP initiation and retention in combination was approximately as effective as increasing only one exclusively. CONCLUSION: Simulation results indicate that expanded PrEP interventions alone may not accomplish GTZ goals within a decade, and integrated scale-up of PrEP, antiretroviral therapy, and other interventions might be necessary.

AB  - PURPOSE: We compared the Doppler sonographic findings in the penile cavernosal artery (arteria profunda penis) after intraurethral instillation and intracorporeal injection of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) to evaluate the hemodynamic changes during drug-induced erection. METHODS: Twenty healthy male volunteers were enrolled in the study. Ten subjects (intraurethral group) were examined with Doppler sonography of the penile cavernosal artery after intraurethral administration of 1 mg of PGE1. The remaining 10 subjects (intracorporeal group) underwent Doppler sonography of the cavernosal artery after intracorporeal injection of 5 microg of PGE1. The peak systolic velocity, minimal diastolic velocity, and resistance index were determined at 5-minute intervals for 30 minutes following administration of PGE1 in both groups. The results were compared between the 2 groups. RESULTS: The peak systolic velocity in the intraurethral group increased progressively from a mean of 31.1 cm/second at 5 minutes to 65.6 cm/second at 30 minutes after intraurethral administration of PGE1. In the intracorporeal group, the mean peak systolic velocity ranged from 44.1 to 83.2 cm/second, reached a maximum at 10 minutes, and then decreased continuously through 30 minutes after intracorporeal injection of PGE1. The mean peak systolic velocities were significantly higher in the intracorporeal group at 10 and 15 minutes (p < or = 0.05); the mean minimal diastolic velocities were significantly lower in the intracorporeal group at 15, 20, and 25 minutes (p < or = 0.05); and the mean resistance indices were significantly higher in the intracorporeal group at all time points except 5 minutes (p < or = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The intracorporeal injection of PGE1 produced a greater vasoactive response in the cavernosal artery than did intraurethral instillation.

AB  - Transforaminal epidural steroid injections (TFESI) are widely used in patients with lumbar foraminal spinal stenosis. Previous studies have evaluated the effects of TFESI on lumbar foraminal spinal stenosis using only pain scores. However, no study has evaluated the effect of TFESI on pain scores and walking distance in patients with lumbar foraminal spinal stenosis. This study aimed to assess the effect of TFESI on pain scores and walking distance in patients with lumbar foraminal spinal stenosis stratified according to disease severity. This retrospective study reviewed the medical records of patients who received TFESI for lumbar foraminal spinal stenosis. A total of 128 patients were divided into the moderate and severe groups based on the extent of fat obliteration and the presence of nerve root compression. A significant decrease in the numeric rating scale (NRS) scores was observed in the moderate and severe groups compared with the corresponding baseline values 4 weeks after TFESI; however, the NRS pain scores were lower in the moderate group than those in the severe group. In addition, the proportion of patients who experienced pain reduction (≥50%) was higher in the moderate group than that in the severe group. The moderate and severe groups showed a significant increase in walking distance compared with the baseline values 4 weeks after the treatment. However, the walking distance values did not differ significantly between the moderate and severe groups. Furthermore, the degree of satisfaction was higher in the moderate group than that in the severe group. Lumbar TFESI may reduce pain scores and increase walking distance in patients with moderate or severe lumbar foraminal spinal stenosis. Patients with moderate foraminal stenosis had better pain relief outcomes than those with severe foraminal stenosis.

AB  - Lumbar spinal stenosis is a common degenerative disorder that is characterized by pain and neurogenic claudication. Previous studies have evaluated the effects of an epidural steroid injection (ESI) on spinal stenosis, based on changes to the spinal canal diameter.This study aimed to examine the impact of the ESI on pain scores and walking distance in patients with lumbar central spinal stenosis, stratified based on disease severity, which was graded according to the degree of cauda equina separation.We reviewed the medical records of patients who received the ESI for lumbar spinal central canal stenosis. A total of 128 patients were divided into moderate and severe groups, based on the degree of cauda equina separation.Relative to baseline values, 2 weeks after the ESI, the moderate group showed a significant decrease in the numeric rating scale (NRS) scores and an increase in walking distance. Meanwhile, the severe group showed a significant decrease in the NRS scores and no significant change in walking distance. The moderate group had lower NRS scores and a longer walking distance than did the severe group 2 weeks after the ESI. The proportion of patients with improved levels of satisfaction was higher in the moderate group than in the severe group.Lumbar interlaminar ESI may reduce pain scores and increase walking distance in patients with moderate lumbar spinal central canal stenosis. Patients with moderate spinal stenosis achieved better outcomes than did patients with severe stenosis.

AB  - Osteoporosis is a common problem, especially among postmenopausal women. Postmenopausal women with osteoporosis have major risk factors for osteoporotic fractures. The abuse of epidural steroid injections (ESIs) or the misunderstanding of their proper use could cause osteoporotic fractures. Therefore, we aimed to investigate whether ESIs are associated with osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women with low back pain and osteoporosis. Furthermore, we aimed to provide evidence on whether ESIs could be used in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis who are at high risk for osteoporotic fractures.We reviewed the medical records of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis but no fractures. A total of 172 postmenopausal women were divided into 2 groups. Group 1 comprised patients receiving medications and Group 2 comprised patients receiving ESIs. All participants received medications for treating osteoporosis. Each patient's age, bone mineral density, body mass index, medical history, and status with respect to smoking, drinking, physical activity, and exercise were obtained using a questionnaire and medical records.The mean total number of ESIs was 6.2, and the mean cumulative administered dose of glucocorticoids (dexamethasone) was 31 mg. The incidences of fractures in the medication and ESI groups were 22% and 24%, respectively, in the thoracolumbar spine, and 2% and 5%, respectively, in the hip joint.There was no significant difference in the incidences of osteoporotic fractures at the thoraco-lumbar spine and hip joint in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis between those who received ESIs (a mean of 6.2 ESIs, a cumulative dexamethasone dose of 31 mg) and those who did not, with both groups taking anti-osteoporotic medications for low back pain. Our data suggest that ESI treatment using a mean of 6.2 ESIs to deliver a maximum cumulative dexamethasone dose of 31 mg could be safely used in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, without any significant impact on the their risk for osteoporotic fractures.

AB  - Vascular remodeling and endothelial dysfunction are important pathogenic features of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). There is a growing body of evidence that proteasome inhibitors may be beneficial in vascular diseases by inhibiting proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and ameliorating endothelial dysfunction. Here, we evaluated whether bortezomib (BTZ) could alleviate hypoxia- and monocrotaline (MCT)-induced PAH. BTZ (at doses from 1 to 100 μg/kg, or a dose of 100 μg/kg) was administered to mice every other day for the last 2 weeks of a 5-week hypoxia (10% O(2)) period, or to rats once daily from Day 22 to Day 34 after MCT challenge, respectively. BTZ treatment substantially suppressed elevation of right ventricular (RV) systolic pressure, RV hypertrophy, and pulmonary vascular remodeling in hypoxia-exposed mice. Similarly, BTZ treatment inhibited RV hypertrophy and vascular remodeling in MCT-injected rats. Strikingly, BTZ rescued 70% of MCT-injected rats up to Day 60, along with a considerable reduction in RV systolic pressure and suppression of vascular remodeling, whereas, among MCT-injected rats not administered BTZ, there were no survivors by Day 41. BTZ significantly suppressed proliferation of pulmonary VSMCs in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, BTZ increased not only endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase (eNOS), phosphorylated eNOS, and NO production in vitro, but also eNOS and p-eNOS in hypoxia-exposed mice and MCT-injected rats, respectively. In contrast to the beneficial effects, BTZ increased active caspase-3 in cardiac ventricles of MCT-injected rats. Taken together, with caution for cardiotoxicity, BTZ could be a potential therapeutic strategy in PAH, possibly acting by inhibition of VSMC proliferation and amelioration of endothelial dysfunction.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To evaluate the predictors of high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) failure in pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF). METHODS: Fifty-two non-HIV-related PCP subjects were divided into a HFNC success group (44%) and a HFNC failure group (who required mechanical ventilation (MV) despite HFNC application) (56%). The clinical characteristics and physiologic effects were retrospectively reviewed and compared between the groups. RESULTS: At baseline, the heart rate, alveolar-arterial PO(2) difference [P(A-a)O(2)], Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, and proportion of subjects who used vasopressors were significantly higher in the HFNC failure group than in the HFNC success group. The 60-day mortality was 52% in the HFNC failure group and 13% in the HFNC success group (P=0.004). The results of the multivariate analysis indicated that the baseline SOFA score was independently associated with HFNC failure (adjusted odds ratio, 1.74 per each score unit increase; 95% CI, 1.05-2.89; P=0.03). Repeated measures analysis of variance revealed that within 6 h of HFNC initiation, the mean PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio decreased and the mean P(A-a)O(2) increased rapidly in the HFNC failure group. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with ARF due to PCP subjected to HFNC therapy should be carefully monitored, and particular attention should be paid to those who had organ dysfunction and did not show early oxygenation improvement.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Meeting sex partners online is associated with increased risk of acquiring sexually transmitted infections. We examined whether different venues where men who have sex with men (MSM) meet sex partners was associated with prevalent Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) infection, and whether prevalence increased during (vs before) the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of data from San Diego's 'Good To Go' sexual health clinic from two enrolment periods: (1) March-September 2019 (pre-COVID-19) and (2) March-September 2021 (during COVID-19). Participants completed self-administered intake assessments. This analysis included males aged ≥18 years self-reporting sex with males within 3 months before enrolment. Participants were categorised as (1) meeting new sex partners in-person only (eg, bars, clubs), (2) meeting new sex partners online (eg, applications, websites) or (3) having sex only with existing partners. We used multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for year, age, race, ethnicity, number of sex partners, pre-exposure prophylaxis use and drug use to examine whether venue or enrolment period were associated with CT/NG infection (either vs none). RESULTS: Among 2546 participants, mean age was 35.5 (range: 18-79) years, 27.9% were non-white and 37.0% were Hispanic. Overall, CT/NG prevalence was 14.8% and was higher during COVID-19 vs pre-COVID-19 (17.0% vs 13.3%). Participants met sex partners online (56.9%), in-person (16.9%) or only had existing partners (26.2%) in the past 3 months. Compared with having only existing sex partners, meeting partners online was associated with higher CT/NG prevalence (adjusted OR (aOR) 2.32; 95% CI 1.51 to 3.65), while meeting partners in-person was not associated with CT/NG prevalence (aOR 1.59; 95% CI 0.87 to 2.89). Enrolment during COVID-19 was associated with higher CT/NG prevalence compared with pre-COVID-19 (aOR 1.42; 95% CI 1.13 to 1.79). CONCLUSIONS: CT/NG prevalence appeared to increase among MSM during COVID-19, and meeting sex partners online was associated with higher prevalence.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Liver cirrhosis, which is caused by the accumulation of extracellular matrix materials, is a serious clinical problem that can progress to hepatic failure. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta) plays a pivotal role in extracellular matrix production, but bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-7, a member of the TGFbeta superfamily, can antagonise the fibrogenic activity of TGFbeta. AIM: In this study, we examined whether adenovirus-mediated overexpression of BMP-7 (Ad-BMP-7) antagonised the effect of TGFbeta in vitro and in vivo. METHODS AND RESULTS: In primary cultured rat stellate cells and the LX-2 human stellate cell line, induction of BMP-7 by Ad-BMP-7 infection decreased the expression of collagen 1A2 mRNA and smooth muscle alpha-actin in the presence or absence of TGFbeta, via Smad 1/5/8 phosphorylation. BMP-7 triggered the mRNA expression of inhibitors of differentiation 2 (Id2) in LX-2. Although endogenous expression of BMP-7 was hardly detectable, Smad1 and Id2 overexpression increased BMP-7 expression in LX-2. A liver fibrosis model was induced by the repetitive intraperitoneal injection of thioacetamide (200 mg/kg body weight) twice per week for up to 7 weeks. In rats administered Ad-BMP-7 via the tail vein, hydroxyproline content and the areas stained by Sirius red dye in the liver were significantly reduced compared to controls. Ad-Id2 also reduced fibrosis. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that BMP-7, Smad 1/5/8 and Ids interact to antagonise hepatic fibrogenesis.

AB  - This supplement to the Journal of the International AIDS Society focuses on the engagement of the social and political sciences within HIV research and, in particular, maintaining a productive relationship between social and biomedical perspectives on HIV. It responds to a number of concerns raised primarily by social scientists, but also recognized as important by biomedical and public health researchers. These concerns include how best to understand the impact of medical technologies (such as HIV treatments, HIV testing, viral load testing, male circumcision, microbicides, and pre-and post-exposure prophylaxis) on sexual cultures, drug practices, relationships and social networks in different cultural, economic and political contexts. The supplement is also concerned with how we might examine the relationship between HIV prevention and treatment, understand the social and political mobilization required to tackle HIV, and sustain the range of disciplinary approaches needed to inform and guide responses to the global pandemic. The six articles included in the supplement demonstrate the value of fostering high quality social and political research to inform, guide and challenge our collaborative responses to HIV/AIDS.

AB  - An informal survey of knowledge about and behaviors relevant to the spread of AIDS was conducted on the street in New York City during October 1986. The sample (n = 204) includes IV drug users (60%) and others (40%). The informal nature of the interview suggests that respondents gave "salient" answers rather than the complete answers that would be expected in a formal interview situation. A smaller proportion of respondents reported salient knowledge about drug-related transmission of AIDS than had been found in other populations, using formal interview methods. A close association was found between any accurate knowledge about spread of AIDS and likelihood of practicing one or more risk reduction behaviors. New users (persons who had been using drugs for only 1 or 2 years) were significantly less likely than others to have salient knowledge about AIDS transmission and also less likely to practice risk reduction measures.

AB  - The fusion domain of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) envelope glycoprotein (gp120-gp41) is a conserved hydrophobic region located at the N terminus of the transmembrane glycoprotein (gp41). A V2E mutant has been shown to dominantly interfere with wild-type envelope-mediated syncytium formation and virus infectivity. To understand this phenomenon, a 33-residue peptide (wild type, WT) identical to the N-terminal segment of gp41 and its V2E mutant were synthesized, fluorescently labeled, and characterized. Both peptides inhibited HIV-1 envelope-mediated cell-cell fusion and had similar alpha-helical content in membrane mimetic environments. Studies with fluorescently labeled peptide analogues revealed that both peptides have high affinity for phospholipid membranes, are susceptible to digestion by proteinase-K in their membrane-bound state, and tend to self- and coassemble in the membranes. In SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis the WT peptide formed dimers as well as higher order oligomers, whereas the V2E mutant only formed dimers. The WT, but not the V2E mutant, induced liposome aggregation, destabilization, and fusion. Moreover, the V2E mutant inhibited vesicle fusion induced by the WT peptide, probably by forming inactive heteroaggregates. These data form the basis for an explanation of the mechanism by which the gp41 V2E mutant inhibits HIV-1 infectivity in cells when co-expressed with WT gp41.

AB  - DP178, a synthetic peptide corresponding to a segment of the transmembrane envelope glycoprotein (gp41) of human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1), is a potent inhibitor of viral infection and virus-mediated cell-cell fusion. Nevertheless, DP178 does not contain gp41 coiled-coil cavity binding residues postulated to be essential for inhibiting HIV-1 entry. We find that DP178 inhibits phospholipid redistribution mediated by the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein at a concentration 8 times greater than that of solute redistribution (the IC(50) values are 43 and 335 nm, respectively). In contrast, C34, a synthetic peptide which overlaps with DP178 but contains the cavity binding residues, did not show this phenomenon (11 and 25 nm, respectively). The ability of DP178 to inhibit membrane fusion at a post-lipid mixing stage correlates with its ability to bind and oligomerize on the surface of membranes. Furthermore, our results are consistent with a model in which DP178 inhibits the formation of gp41 viral hairpin structure at low affinity, whereas C34 inhibits its formation at high affinity: the failure to form the viral hairpin prevents both lipid and solute from redistributing between cells. However, our data also suggest an additional membrane-bound inhibitory site for DP178 in the ectodomain of gp41 within a region immediately adjacent to the membrane-spanning domain. By binding to this higher affinity site, DP178 inhibits the recruitment of several gp41-membrane complexes, thus inhibiting fusion pore formation.

AB  - The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 gp41 ectodomain forms a three-hairpin protease-resistant core in the absence of membranes, namely, the putative gp41 fusion-active state. Here, we show that recombinant proteins corresponding to the ectodomain of gp41, but lacking the fusion peptide, bind membranes and consequently undergo a major conformational change. As a result, the protease-resistant core becomes susceptible to proteolytic digestion. Accordingly, synthetic peptides corresponding to the segments that construct this core bind the membrane. It is remarkable that the hetero-oligomer formed by these peptides dissociates upon binding to the membrane. These results are consistent with a model in which, after the three-hairpin conformation is formed, membrane binding induces opening of the gp41 core complex. We speculate that binding of the segments that constructed the core to the viral and cellular membranes could bring the membranes closer together and facilitate their merging.

AB  - In 2008, we published the first set of guidelines for standardizing research in autophagy. Since then, this topic has received increasing attention, and many scientists have entered the field. Our knowledge base and relevant new technologies have also been expanding. Thus, it is important to formulate on a regular basis updated guidelines for monitoring autophagy in different organisms. Despite numerous reviews, there continues to be confusion regarding acceptable methods to evaluate autophagy, especially in multicellular eukaryotes. Here, we present a set of guidelines for investigators to select and interpret methods to examine autophagy and related processes, and for reviewers to provide realistic and reasonable critiques of reports that are focused on these processes. These guidelines are not meant to be a dogmatic set of rules, because the appropriateness of any assay largely depends on the question being asked and the system being used. Moreover, no individual assay is perfect for every situation, calling for the use of multiple techniques to properly monitor autophagy in each experimental setting. Finally, several core components of the autophagy machinery have been implicated in distinct autophagic processes (canonical and noncanonical autophagy), implying that genetic approaches to block autophagy should rely on targeting two or more autophagy-related genes that ideally participate in distinct steps of the pathway. Along similar lines, because multiple proteins involved in autophagy also regulate other cellular pathways including apoptosis, not all of them can be used as a specific marker for bona fide autophagic responses. Here, we critically discuss current methods of assessing autophagy and the information they can, or cannot, provide. Our ultimate goal is to encourage intellectual and technical innovation in the field.

AB  - Lipid-conjugated peptides have advanced the understanding of membrane protein functions and the roles of lipids in the membrane milieu. These lipopeptides modulate various biological systems such as viral fusion. A single function has been suggested for the lipid, binding to the membrane and thus elevating the local concentration of the peptide at the target site. In the present paper, we challenged this argument by exploring in-depth the antiviral mechanism of lipopeptides, which comprise sphinganine, the lipid backbone of DHSM (dihydrosphingomyelin), and an HIV-1 envelope-derived peptide. Surprisingly, we discovered a partnership between the lipid and the peptide that impaired early membrane fusion events by reducing CD4 receptor lateral diffusion and HIV-1 fusion peptide-mediated lipid mixing. Moreover, only the joint function of sphinganine and its conjugate peptide disrupted HIV-1 fusion protein assembly and folding at the later fusion steps. Via imaging techniques we revealed for the first time the direct localization of these lipopeptides to the virus-cell and cell-cell contact sites. Overall, the findings of the present study may suggest lipid-protein interactions in various biological systems and may help uncover a role for elevated DHSM in HIV-1 and its target cell membranes.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Rapid induction of β-PDGF receptor (β-PDGFR) is a core feature of hepatic stellate cell activation, but its cellular impact in vivo is not well characterized. We explored the contribution of β-PDGFR-mediated pathway activation to hepatic stellate cell responses in liver injury, fibrogenesis, and carcinogenesis in vivo using genetic models with divergent β-PDGFR activity, and assessed its prognostic implications in human cirrhosis. METHODS: The impact of either loss or constitutive activation of β-PDGFR in stellate cells on fibrosis was assessed following carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) or bile duct ligation. Hepatocarcinogenesis in fibrotic liver was tracked after a single dose of diethylnitrosamine (DEN) followed by repeated injections of CCl4. Genome-wide expression profiling was performed from isolated stellate cells that expressed or lacked β-PDGFR to determine deregulated pathways and evaluate their association with prognostic gene signatures in human cirrhosis. RESULTS: Depletion of β-PDGFR in hepatic stellate cells decreased injury and fibrosis in vivo, while its auto-activation accelerated fibrosis. However, there was no difference in development of DEN-induced pre-neoplastic foci. Genomic profiling revealed ERK, AKT, and NF-κB pathways and a subset of a previously identified 186-gene prognostic signature in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related cirrhosis as downstream of β-PDGFR in stellate cells. In the human cohort, the β-PDGFR signature was not associated with HCC development, but was significantly associated with a poorer outcome in HCV cirrhosis. CONCLUSIONS: β-PDGFR is a key mediator of hepatic injury and fibrogenesis in vivo and contributes to the poor prognosis of human cirrhosis, but not by increasing HCC development.

AB  - The most common method of syringe exchange program (SEP) development in the United States has been for SEPs to be started by activists without funding and then to become a government-funded community-based organization. This developmental process, which has not been studied to date, involves major organizational change. We report our findings on three New York City syringe exchanges experiencing this type of transition. Our data illustrate that following legalization, increased legitimacy and funding allowed all three SEPs to expand the size and scope of their programs (e.g., adding hours, sites, referral services, and the ability to support user groups), resulting in a rapid growth in participation (over 15,000 in 18 months). Regulation accompanying legalization posed significant challenges to SEPs, including added record-keeping and reporting tasks, increased demand for referrals, and accommodating evaluation, which affected already overburdened staffs. The transition process poses significant challenges to these developing organizations as well as opportunities for improved services.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Much remains unknown in rural risk environments, despite a growing crisis in these areas. We adapt a risk environment framework to characterize rural southern Illinois and describe the relations of risk environments, opioid-related overdose, HIV, Hepatitis C, and sexually transmitted infection rates between 2015 and 2017. METHODS: Over two dozen risk environment variables are summarized across zip-code (n = 128) or county levels (n = 16) based on availability and theoretical relevance. We calculate data attribute associations and characterize spatial and temporal dimensions of longitudinal health outcomes and the rural risk environment. We then use a "regional typology analysis" to generate data-driven risk regions and compare health outcomes. RESULTS: Pervasive risk hotspots were identified in more populated locales with higher rates of overdose and HCV incidence, whereas emerging risk areas were isolated to more rural locales that had experienced an increase in analgesic opiate overdoses and generally lacked harm-reduction resources. At-risk areas were characterized with underlying socioeconomic vulnerability but in differing ways, reflecting a nuanced and shifting structural risk landscape. CONCLUSIONS: Rural risk environment vulnerabilities and associated opioid-related health outcomes are multifaceted and spatially heterogeneous. More research is needed to better understand how refining geographies to more precisely define risk can support intervention efforts and further enrich investigations of the opioid epidemic.

AB  - Social insect colonies have survived over evolutionary time in part due to the success of their collaborative methods: using local information and distributed decision making algorithms to detect and exploit critical resources in their environment. These methods have the unusual and useful ability to detect anomalies rapidly, with very little memory, and using only very local information. Our research investigates the potential for a self-organizing anomaly detection system inspired by those observed naturally in colonies of honey bees. We provide a summary of findings from a recently presented algorithm for a nonparametric, fully distributed coordination framework that translates the biological success of these methods into analogous operations for use in cyber defense and discuss the features that inspired this translation. We explore the impacts on detection performance of the defined range of distributed communication for each node and of involving only a small percentage of total nodes in the network in the distributed detection communication. We evaluate our algorithm using a software-based testing implementation, and demonstrate up to 20 percent improvement in detection capability over parallel isolated anomaly detectors.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Viral load is one of the most important determinants for HIV transmission. Identification of people with high viral load (PHVL) can be effective in limiting onward HIV transmission. In order to improve the identification of these individuals within risk networks, we determined a) the number of PHVL recruited through risk networks b) their socio-demographic, behavioural and clinical characteristics and c) the characteristics of individuals who referred these PHVL to the study. METHODOLOGY: From November 2013 to March 2016, in Odessa, Ukraine, Transmission Reduction Intervention Project (TRIP) was implemented to identify people recently infected with HIV within the risk networks of "seeds" and "venues" where they engaged in risk behaviour. RESULTS: TRIP identified 53 PHVL, of whom 32 (60%) injected drugs; 42 (79%) were unaware of their HIV status; 25 (47%) had more than one sex partner, and only 14 (26%) were using condoms. There were 164 people who referred individuals into the study; 33 of them (20%) referred PHVL. In terms of referrers, those with lower than secondary level of education, not living with a sex partner, and reporting regular condom use were significantly more likely (p < 0.05) to refer PHVL. Most PHVL (38, 72%) and their referrers (27, 82%) were found through venues. CONCLUSIONS: In Odessa city, PHVL are at high risk of transmitting HIV as the majority inject drugs, do not know their HIV status, and have unprotected sex and/or multiple partners. Targeting these individuals for HIV prevention, harm reduction and initiation of antiretroviral treatment (ART) is urgent.

AB  - BACKGROUND: New diagnoses of HIV-1 infection among people who inject drugs (PWID) increased significantly during 2011 in Athens. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to investigate the patterns of HIV epidemic spread among PWID and to estimate the transmission dynamics for the major local transmission networks (LTNs). METHODS: We analyzed sequences from 2,274 HIV-infected subjects sampled in Greece during 01/01/2011-31/10/2014. Of specimens in our sample, 874 sequences were isolated from HIV-infected PWID. Phylodynamic analysis was performed using birth-death serial skyline models. RESULTS: Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the majority of sequences from PWID (N=746, 85.4%) fell within four LTNs: CRF14_BG (N=456, 58.3%), CRF35_AD (N=149, 19.1%), subtype B (N=118, 15.1%) and A1 (N=59, 7.5%). In addition to PWID, we also found that sequences from 36 non-PWID belonged to the LTNs corresponding to cross-group transmissions. Based on the estimated plots of the effective reproductive number (Re) over time, subtype A1 and CRF35_AD LTNs showed a sharp increase before and during 2011 (maximum value of Re=3.0 and Re=4.6, respectively). For subtype B and CRF14_BG LTNs, the Re was increasing until the end of 2012 (maximum value of Re=3.2 and Re=3.0, respectively). CONCLUSION: HIV transmissions within subtype A1 and CRF35_AD LTNs increased sharply during the early stage of the outbreak, in contrast to subtype B and CRF14_BG. A significant reduction in the number of infections was estimated on all transmission networks from the beginning of 2013 onwards. Prevention measures that took place in the Athens metropolitan area at the end of 2012 including also the ARISTOTLE program may explain this decrease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: TRIP (Transmission Reduction Intervention Project) was a network-based, contact tracing approach to locate and link to care, mostly people who inject drugs (PWID) with recent HIV infection. OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether sequences from HIV-infected participants with high viral load cluster together more frequently than what is expected by chance. METHODS: Paired end reads were generated for 104 samples using Illumina MiSeq next-generation sequencing. RESULTS: 63 sequences belonged to previously identified local transmission networks of PWID (LTNs) of an HIV outbreak in Athens, Greece. For two HIV-RNA cut-offs (105 and 106 IU/mL), HIV transmissions were more likely between PWID with similar levels of HIV-RNA (p<0.001). 10 of the 14 sequences (71.4%) from PWID with HIV-RNA >106 IU/mL were clustered in 5 pairs. For 4 of these clusters (80%), there was in each one of them at least one sequence from a recently HIVinfected PWID. CONCLUSION: We showed that transmissions are more likely among PWID with high viremia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Improving HIV diagnosis, access to care and effective antiretroviral treatment provides our global strategy to reduce HIV incidence. To reach this goal we need to increase our knowledge about local epidemics. HIV infection dates would be an important information towards this goal, but they are largely unknown. To date, methods to estimate the dates of HIV infection are based mainly on laboratory or molecular methods. Our aim was to validate molecular clock inferred infection dates that were estimated by analysing sequences from 145 people living with HIV (PLHIV) with known transmission dates (clinically estimated infection dates). METHODS: All HIV sequences were obtained by Sanger sequencing and were previously found to belong to well-established molecular transmission clusters (MTCs). RESULTS: Our analysis showed that the molecular clock inferred infection dates were correlated with the clinically estimated ones (Spearman's Correlation coefficient = 0.93, p < 0.001) and that there was an agreement between them (Lin's concordance correlation coefficient = 0.92, p < 0.001). For the 61.4% of cases the molecular clock inferred preceded the clinically estimated infection dates. The median difference between clinically and molecularly estimated dates of infection was of 0.18 (IQR: -0.21, 0.89) years. The lowest differences were identified in people who inject drugs of our study population. CONCLUSIONS: The estimated time to more recent common ancestor (t(MRCA)) of nodes within clusters provides a reliable approximation of HIV infections for PLHIV infected within MTCs. Next-generation sequencing data and molecular clock estimates based on heterochronous sequences provide, probably, more reliable methods for inferring infection dates. However, since these data are not available in most of the HIV clinical laboratories, our approach, under specific conditions, can provide a reliable estimation of HIV infection dates and can be used for HIV public health interventions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Transmission Reduction Intervention Project (TRIP) is a network-based intervention that aims at decreasing human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) spread. We herein explore associations between transmission links as estimated by phylogenetic analyses, and social network-based ties among persons who inject drugs (PWID) recruited in TRIP. METHODS: Phylogenetic trees were inferred from HIV-1 sequences of TRIP participants. Highly supported phylogenetic clusters (transmission clusters) were those fulfilling 3 different phylogenetic confidence criteria. Social network-based ties (injecting or sexual partners, same venue engagement) were determined based on personal interviews, recruitment links, and field observation. RESULTS: TRIP recruited 356 individuals (90.2% PWID) including HIV-negative controls; recently HIV-infected seeds; long-term HIV-infected seeds; and their social network members. Of the 150 HIV-infected participants, 118 (78.7%) were phylogenetically analyzed. Phylogenetic analyses suggested the existence of 13 transmission clusters with 32 sequences. Seven of these clusters included 14 individuals (14/32 [43.8%]) who also had social ties with at least 1 member of their cluster. This proportion was significantly higher than what was expected by chance. CONCLUSIONS: Molecular methods can identify HIV-infected people socially linked with another person in about half of the phylogenetic clusters. This could help public health efforts to locate individuals in networks with high transmission rates.

AB  - We conducted a community-based study of the prevalence and correlates of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and immunization among young adults in a "drug supermarket" neighborhood in New York City. Four hundred eighty-nine young adults ages 18-24 years were recruited from Bushwick, Brooklyn through multistage household probability sampling (n = 332) and targeted sampling (n = 157), interviewed, and tested for three hepatitis B markers (HBsAg, anti-HBc, and anti-HBs). Serological evidence of HBV infection was found in 8.0% (6.0% in the household sample and 12.1% in the targeted sample) and of hepatitis B immunization in 19.6% (22.6% in the household sample and 13.4% in the targeted sample). HBV infection was higher among young adults who either used crack or injected drugs and among those who traded sex for money or drugs. Having Medicaid was significantly associated with lower odds of infection in the household sample and higher odds of immunization in the targeted sample. Although adolescent hepatitis B immunization has been a public health priority in the United States since 1995, nearly three-quarters of young adults in this community did not have serological evidence of being either exposed or immunized. Whereas subsequent younger generations benefited from universal childhood hepatitis B immunization, this particular cohort of young adults who live in communities like Bushwick presents a unique group for prevention intervention.

AB  - Studies among injection drug users (IDUs) find a higher prevalence of HIV infection among black and Puerto Rican IDUs than among white IDUs. Risk behaviors seldom explain these differences. We examine how risk networks contribute to racial/ethnic variations in HIV prevalence. Six hundred sixty-two IDUs were recruited on the street in Bushwick (New York City), interviewed, and tested for HIV. Risk behaviors and networks were analyzed to explain racial/ethnic variations in HIV. Forty percent of IDUs were infected with HIV. HIV prevalence was greater for Puerto Ricans (45%) and blacks (44%) than for whites (32%). Egocentric sexual and drug risk networks were predominantly racially/ethnically homogeneous. After multivariate adjustments for risk behaviors and risk networks, black-white differences in HIV prevalence were no longer significant. Although differences between Puerto Ricans and whites persisted, post hoc analyses suggested that network partner characteristics might explain these differences. In Bushwick, racially/ethnically discordant risk partnerships involving black IDUs may function as potential bridges of transmission between groups.

AB  - Internally displaced persons are often excluded from HIV molecular epidemiology surveillance due to structural, behavioral, and social barriers in access to treatment. We test a field-based molecular epidemiology framework to study HIV transmission dynamics in a hard-to-reach and highly stigmatized group, internally displaced people who inject drugs (IDPWIDs). We inform the framework by Nanopore generated HIV pol sequences and IDPWID migration history. In June-September 2020, we recruited 164 IDPWID in Odesa, Ukraine, and obtained 34 HIV sequences from HIV-infected participants. We aligned them to publicly available sequences (N = 359) from Odesa and IDPWID regions of origin and identified 7 phylogenetic clusters with at least 1 IDPWID. Using times to the most recent common ancestors of the identified clusters and times of IDPWID relocation to Odesa, we infer potential post-displacement transmission window when infections likely to happen to be between 10 and 21 months, not exceeding 4 years. Phylogeographic analysis of the sequence data shows that local people in Odesa disproportionally transmit HIV to the IDPWID community. Rapid transmissions post-displacement in the IDPWID community might be associated with slow progression along the HIV continuum of care: only 63% of IDPWID were aware of their status, 40% of those were in antiviral treatment, and 43% of those were virally suppressed. Such HIV molecular epidemiology investigations are feasible in transient and hard-to-reach communities and can help indicate best times for HIV preventive interventions. Our findings highlight the need to rapidly integrate Ukrainian IDPWID into prevention and treatment services following the dramatic escalation of the war in 2022.

AB  - Hepatitis C virus (HCV) vaccine development remains at an early stage. We explored the economic and health consequences of potential HCV vaccines by comparing universal vaccination with a hepatitis C vaccine to no vaccination in two groups: (1) injecting drug users (IDU); (2) all 12 year olds, using a Markov cohort simulation. Among IDUs, vaccination would avert 248 cases of HCV infection and 89 HCV-related deaths per 1000 individuals, and reduce costs. In average risk cohorts, vaccination did not reduce costs but was reasonably cost effective. These results provide encouragement to vaccine developers that a vaccine that is moderately effective and reasonably priced should not face economic barriers to implementation and will be attractive to third party payers.

AB  - While there have been numerous papers published in the medical, social, and epidemiologic literature about the effectiveness of syringe exchange programs (SEPs), few papers identify operational characteristics of the SEPs they study or assess which of those characteristics are associated with optimal HIV risk reduction among clients. The objective of this study was to examine whether different syringe dispensation policies were associated with client-level injection-related HIV risk. Injection drug users (IDUs) were recruited at 23 SEPs in California in 2001 (n = 531). SEPs were classified by their executive directors as to whether they provided a strict one-for-one syringe exchange, gave a few extra syringes above the one-for-one exchange, or distributed the amount of syringes based upon need as opposed to how many syringes were turned in by the clients. Injection-related risk was compared by SEP program type. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, clients of distribution-based programs had lower odds of reusing syringes (adjusted odds ratio = 0.43; 95% CI = 0.27, 0.71) when adjusting for confounding variables. There were no statistical differences with regards to distributive or receptive syringe sharing by dispensation policy. It is concluded that SEPs that base syringe dispensation policy upon need may facilitate reductions in reuse of syringes.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study deter- mined human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seroprevalence and factors associated with HIV infection among street-recruited injection drug users and crack cocaine smokers. METHODS: An analysis was performed on HIV serologies and risk behaviors of 6402 injection drug users and 3383 crack smokers in 16 US municipalities in 1992 and 1993. RESULTS: HIV seroprevalence was 12.7% among injection drug users and 7.5% among crack smokers. Most high-seroprevalence municipalities (>25%) were located along the eastern seaboard of the United States. In high-seroprevalence municipalities, but not in others, HIV seroprevalence was higher for injection drug users than for crack smokers. Among injection drug users, cocaine injection, use of speedballs (cocaine or amphetamines with heroin), and sexual risk behaviors were independently associated with HIV infection. Among crack smokers, sexual risk behaviors were associated with HIV infection. CONCLUSIONS: Injection drug users and crack smokers are at high risk for HIV infection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Many new HIV-1 infections in the USA occur in injection drug users (IDUs). HIV-1seroconversion of IDUs is mainly associated with injection-related risk factors. Harm- reduction programmes concentrate on injection-risk behaviour. We aimed to establish whether injection or sexual risk factors, or both, were associated with HIV-1antibody seroconversion of street-recruited IDUs in San Francisco, from 1986 to 1998. METHODS: IDUs were enrolled every 6 months from four community sites. We did a nested case-control study comparing 58 respondents who seroconverted between visits with 1134 controls who remained seronegative. Controls were matched with cases by sex and date. Adjusted odds ratios and 95% CI were calculated for men and women by use of conditional logistic regression. FINDINGS: Men who had sex with men were 8.8 times as likely to seroconvert (95% CI 3.7-20.5) as heterosexual men. Women who reported having traded sex for money in the past year were 5.1 times as likely as others to seroconvert (95% CI 1.9-13.7). Women younger than 40 years were more likely to seroconvert than those 40 years or older (2.8 [1.05-7.6]), and women who reported having a steady sex-partner who injected drugs were less likely to seroconvert than other women (0.32 [0.11-0.92]). INTERPRETATION: HIV-1 seroconversion of street-recruited IDUs in San Francisco is strongly associated with sexual behaviour. HIV-1risk might be reduced by incorporation of innovative sexual-risk-reduction strategies into harm-reduction programmes.

AB  - The objective of this study was to analyze HIV-related risks of women injection drug users (IDU) and crack cocaine users (CCU) who have sex with women (WSW). IDU and CCU women (N = 3856) were recruited from street settings in 19 U.S. cities between 1992 and 1994. For this study, we analyze data on 231 women who reported female sex partners in the 30 days before interview. In the 30 days before interview, 53% of IDUs had shared syringes, and 66% had shared injection supplies. Only 11 women (6%) always used barrier protection while giving oral sex to women and 5 (3%) while receiving oral sex from women in the 30 days before interview. Fifty percent had sex with men as well as women in the previous 30 days. Thirty percent of women who reported sex with men had used condoms for penile-vaginal sex, and 26% for penile-anal sex. In logistic regression analysis modeling sex with men in the previous 30 days, sex work was predictive, "lesbian" self-identification was protective, and the interaction between these two terms was predictive, while controlling for race and age. Differences in risk perception were significant between women who reported varying sexual risks, but not significant between women who reported varying injection-related risks. There is a high prevalence of risky sex and drug behaviors among drug-using WSWs. There is a need for epidemiological studies specifically geared toward studying risk behaviors among WSWs. Risk reduction activities need to focus on injection-related risks, as well as sex-related risks, among WSWs.

AB  - This study funded by Centers for Disease Control compares HIV prevalence and risk behavior among heterosexual methamphetamine (n = 428) and nonmethamphetamine (n = 878) injectors in California, USA, during 2001-2003. While HIV was not highly prevalent among methamphetamine injectors (3%), sexual and injection risk behaviors were highly prevalent (ranging from 21% to 72%). In multivariate analyses, methamphetamine injectors had higher odds than nonmethamphetamine injectors of unprotected vaginal intercourse and sex with five or more sexual partners in the past 6 months and of distributive and receptive syringe sharing in the past 30 days. There was no significant difference in HIV sero-status by methamphetamine use. Suggestions are made for designing HIV prevention programs. The study's limitations are noted.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic poses significant challenges to people with opioid use disorder (OUD). As localities enforce lockdowns and pass emergency OUD treatment regulations, questions arise about how these changes will affect access and retention in care. In this study, we explore the influence of COVID-19 on access to, experiences with, and motivations for OUD treatment through a qualitative analysis of public discussion forums on Reddit. METHODS: We collected data from Reddit, a free and international online platform dedicated to public discussions and user-generated content. We extracted 1000 of the most recent posts uploaded between March 5th and May 13th, 2020 from each of the two most popular opioid subreddits "r/Opiates" and "r/OpiatesRecovery" (total 2000). We reviewed posts for relevance to COVID-19 and opioid use and coded content using a hybrid inductive-deductive approach. Thematic analysis identified common themes related to study questions of interest. RESULTS: Of 2000 posts reviewed, 300 (15%) discussed topics related to the intersection of opioid use and COVID-19. Five major themes related to OUD treatment were identified: Concern about closure of OUD treatment services; transition to telehealth and virtual care; methadone treatment requirements and increased exposure to COVID-19; reactions to changing regulations on medications for OUD; and influences of the pandemic on treatment motivation and progress. CONCLUSION: In the face of unprecedented challenges due to COVID-19, reactions of Reddit opioid forum users ranged from increased distress in accessing and sustaining treatment, to encouragement surrounding new modes of treatment and opportunities to engage in care. New and less restrictive avenues for treatment were welcomed by many, but questions remain about how new norms and policy changes will be sustained beyond this pandemic and impact OUD treatment access and outcomes long-term.

AB  - Medication adherence among HIV-infected individuals is critical to limit disease progression and onward transmission. Evidence indicates that among youth living with HIV (YLH), adherence is suboptimal and related to co-morbid psychosocial conditions. Cross-sectional data from 212 YLH, ages 16-29, collected between 2011-2014 in Chicago were analyzed to assess the relationship of multiple psychosocial conditions (e.g., depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, moderate/heavy marijuana use, moderate/heavy alcohol use, HIV-related stigma) to ART adherence (i.e., a "syndemic.") Adherence was regressed on an index of increasing numbers of psychosocial conditions, controlling for demographic and treatment factors as well as enrollment site. The mean age of participants was 24, 89% were male, 87% black, and 91% behaviorally infected. Psychosocial conditions were prevalent, including 38% and 34% with high depressive and anxiety symptoms, respectively, 54% and 25% with a moderate/high level of marijuana and alcohol use, respectively, and 46% reporting high HIV-related stigma. In regression analysis, the likelihood of ART adherence decreased with the number of syndemic conditions (linear dose response, p = 0.02) as did the odds of viral load suppression (p = 0.008). Interventions to address these conditions in concert with biomedical treatment as prevention for YLH are needed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Peer-to-peer injection (either providing or receiving an injection to/from a person who injects drugs [PWID]) is common (19%-50%) among PWID. Most studies of peer-to-peer injection have focused on receiving injection assistance, with fewer examining providing injection assistance and none considering characteristics of PWID who do both. We examined characteristics of PWID by peer-to-peer injection categories (receiving, providing, both, and neither) and determined if these behaviors were associated with receptive and distributive syringe sharing. METHODS: Los Angeles and San Francisco PWID (N = 777) were recruited using targeted sampling methods and interviewed during 2011-2013. Multinomial logistic regression was used to determine characteristics associated with peer-to-peer injection categories and logistic regression was used to examine if peer-to-peer categories were independently associated with distributive and receptive syringe sharing. RESULTS: Recent peer-to-peer injection was reported by 42% of PWID (18% provider; 14% recipient; 10% both). In multinomial regression analysis, PWID reporting any peer-to-peer injection were more likely to inject with others than those who did neither. Injection providers and those who did both were associated with more frequent injection, illegal income source, and methamphetamine injection while injection recipients were associated with fewer years of injection. Injection providers were younger, had more years of injecting, and were more likely to inject heroin than PWID who did neither. In multivariate analyses, we found that providers and PWID who did both were significantly more likely to report receptive and distributive syringe sharing than PWID who did neither. CONCLUSION: Peer-to-peer injection is associated with HIV/HCV risk. Current prevention strategies may not sufficiently address these behaviors. Modification of existing interventions and development of new interventions to better respond to peer-to-peer injection is urgently needed.

AB  - Syringe service programs (SSPs), which provide access to sterile syringes and other injection equipment and their safe disposal after use,* represent a highly successful human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention intervention. SSPs are associated with a 58% reduction in the incidence of HIV infection among persons who inject drugs (1). In addition, SSPs have led efforts to prevent opioid overdose deaths by integrating evidence-based opioid overdose education and naloxone distribution (OEND) programs (2-4). OEND programs train laypersons to respond during overdose events and provide access to naloxone and directions for drug delivery (2-4). SSPs are ideal places for OEND because they provide culturally relevant services designed to reach persons at high risk for experiencing or observing an opioid overdose. A 2013 survey found that only 55% of SSPs in the United States had implemented OEND (5). To characterize current implementation of OEND among SSPs, and to describe the current reach (i.e., the ratio of persons who received naloxone per opioid overdose death and the ratio of naloxone doses distributed per opioid overdose death) of SSP-based OEND programs by U.S. Census division,(†) a survey of known U.S. SSPs was conducted in 2019, which found that 94% of SSPs had implemented OEND. In addition, the reach of SSP-based OEND programs varied by U.S. Census division. Scaling up of SSP-based OEND delivery programs could be a critical component for areas of the country with high opioid overdose death rates and low reach.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Over the last several years, fentanyl has been introduced into the illicit drug supply in the United States. While the impact of fentanyl on overdose fatalities is clear, the increase in fentanyl use may also be affecting drug use practices with implications for infectious disease transmission. We conducted a cross-sectional survey to explore associations of perceived illicit fentanyl use with opioid use frequency, injection frequency and syringe sharing among people who inject drugs in two California cities. METHODS: People who inject drugs (PWID) were recruited from community settings in Los Angeles and San Francisco, CA from June 2017 to September 2018. Multivariable logistic regression was used to explore adjusted associations between perceived illicit fentanyl use and high frequency opioid use, high frequency injection and syringe sharing. RESULTS: Among the 395 study participants, the median age of participants was 44 years; 74% of participants were cisgender male; 73% reported to be homeless; 61% lived in San Francisco and 39% in Los Angeles. The prevalence of perceived illicit fentanyl use in the past six months was 50.4% (95% confidence interval (CI): 45.4%-55.3%) among PWID. Findings from our adjusted logistic regression models suggested that people reporting perceived illicit fentanyl use had a greater odds of high frequency opioid use (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 2.36; 95% CI: 1.43-3.91; p = 0.001), high frequency injection (aOR = 1.84; 95% CI: 1.08-3.13; p = 0.03) and receptive syringe sharing (aOR = 2.16; 95% CI: 1.06-4.36; p = 0.03), as compared to people using heroin and other street drugs but not fentanyl. CONCLUSION: People reporting perceived illicit fentanyl use were at increased risk for injection-related infectious disease risks. Actions must be taken to reduce these risks, including improved access to syringe service programs and opioid treatment and consideration of innovative approaches, such as supervised consumption services.

AB  - Advanced systemic mastocytosis is a rare and still untreatable disease. Blocking antibodies against inhibitory receptors, also known as "immune checkpoints", have revolutionized anti-cancer treatment. Inhibitory receptors are expressed not only on normal immune cells, including mast cells but also on neoplastic cells. Whether activation of inhibitory receptors through monoclonal antibodies can lead to tumor growth inhibition remains mostly unknown. Here we show that the inhibitory receptor Siglec-7 is expressed by primary neoplastic mast cells in patients with systemic mastocytosis and by mast cell leukemia cell lines. Activation of Siglec-7 by anti-Siglec-7 monoclonal antibody caused phosphorylation of Src homology region 2 domain-containing phosphatase-1 (SHP-1), reduced phosphorylation of KIT and induced growth inhibition in mast cell lines. In SCID-beige mice injected with either the human mast cell line HMC-1.1 and HMC-1.2 or with Siglec-7 transduced B cell lymphoma cells, anti-Siglec-7 monoclonal antibody reduced tumor growth by a mechanism involving Siglec-7 cytoplasmic domains in "preventive" and "treatment" settings. These data demonstrate that activation of Siglec-7 on mast cell lines can inhibit their growth in vitro and in vivo. This might pave the way to additional treatment strategies for mastocytosis.

AB  - HIV selectively inhibited the proliferative response of clonal CD4+ T lymphocytes to alloantigen while other alloantigen-dependent responses were unperturbed. Specifically, impaired blastogenesis could be dissociated from alloantigen-specific induction of the B cell activation molecule CD23, IL-4 release, and inositol lipid hydrolysis. In addition, membrane expression of pertinent T cell receptor molecules, including CD2, CD3, and T cell antigen receptor (Ti), remained intact. Using two MHC class II-specific human CD4+ helper T cell clones, the proliferative defect was shown to be an early consequence of HIV infection, occurring within 4 d of viral inoculation and preceding increases in mature virion production. It was generalizable to three distinct methods of T cell activation, all independent of antigen-presenting cells: anti-CD3 mediated cross-linking of the CD3/Ti complex; anti-CD2 and phorbol 12-myristic 13-acetate (PMA); and anti-CD28 plus PMA. These abnormalities were not mitigated by addition of exogenous IL-2, even though expression of the IL-2 receptor (CD25) was unaltered. These studies define a selective blockade in T cell function early after HIV exposure that could serve as a model for certain in vivo manifestations of AIDS.

AB  - Two alloreactive human CD4+ T cell clones, recognizing HLA-DR2 and HLA-DR1 determinants, lost their specific proliferative capacity after infection with HIV. This system was used to explore the effect of polyI.polyC12U on HIV replication and immune suppression. The mismatched double-stranded RNA blocked HIV-associated particulate reverse transcriptase activity and viral-mediated cytopathic effects. Also, polyI.polyC12U preserved the alloreactivity of T cell clones after exposure to HIV.PolyI.polyC12U appeared to act at a level subsequent to host cell infection and reverse transcription. It had no effect on the enhancement of gene expression by the HIV transcription unit tatIII. These findings indicate that early in the course of infection of CD4+ T lymphocytes, HIV can directly abrogate proliferation to specific allodeterminants, and that this function is preserved in the presence of polyI.polyC12U. They also provide insight into the mechanism of antiviral action of a class of agent with potential clinical utility in AIDS.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Two randomized, controlled studies comparing outcomes in patients treated with direct oral anticoagulants or low-molecular weight heparin for cancer-associated venous thromboembolism (VTE) have previously been performed. However, gynecologic cancers accounted for approximately 10% of the study populations. We compared the outcomes of patients with primary gynecological cancers who were treated for cancer-associated VTE with either rivaroxaban or dalteparin. METHODS: The 162 eligible patients with gynecologic cancers who were treated with either dalteparin (n=60) or rivaroxaban (n=102) were reviewed. The primary outcome was a composite event, which included recurrence or clinically relevant bleeding events during the therapeutic period. Secondary outcomes were recurrence, clinically relevant bleeding events, and mortality. RESULTS: During the therapeutic period, there were no significant differences between the groups in the proportion of composite events, recurrence, or clinically relevant bleeding. Multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazards model also showed no significant difference in the number of composite events and clinically relevant bleeding between the groups. In the rivaroxaban group, 44.0% of patients experienced gastrointestinal bleeding and 24.0% experienced urinary tract bleeding. In the dalteparin group, bleeding was most common in the urinary tract (44.4%) and at the injection site (22.2%). CONCLUSION: In this study, although there were no significant differences in effectiveness or safety between the rivaroxaban and dalteparin groups, rivaroxaban use was associated with a higher rate of clinically relevant bleeding than dalteparin. Therefore, caution should be taken when prescribing rivaroxaban for gynecologic cancer-associated VTE and bleeding events should be carefully monitored.

AB  - Biopolymers bearing hydrophobic side-chains, such as hydrophobically modified chitosan (hmC), can connect liposomes into a gel network via hydrophobic interactions. In this paper, we show that such liposome gels possess an attractive combination of properties for certain drug delivery applications. Their shear-thinning property allows these gels to be injected at a particular site, while their gel-like nature at rest ensures that the material will remain localized at that site. Moreover, drugs can be encapsulated in the interior of the liposomes and delivered at the local site for an extended period of time. The presence of two transport resistances - from the liposomal bilayer and the gel network - is shown to be responsible for the sustained release; in turn, disruption of the liposomes both weakens the gel and causes a faster release. We have monitored release kinetics from liposome gels of a cationic anticancer drug doxorubicin (Dox) encapsulated in liposomes. Sustained release of Dox from these gels and the concomitant cytotoxic effect could be observed for over a week.

AB  - Three-dimensional (3D) printing is perceived as an innovative tool for change in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine based on research outcomes on the development of artificial organs and tissues. With advances in such technology, research is underway into 3D-printed artificial scaffolds for tissue recovery and regeneration. In this study, we fabricated artificial scaffolds by coating bone demineralized and decellularized extracellular matrix (bdECM) onto existing 3D-printed polycaprolactone/tricalcium phosphate (PCL/TCP) to enhance osteoconductivity and osteoinductivity. After injecting adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) in an aggregate form found to be effective in previous studies, we examined the effects of the scaffold on ossification during mandibular reconstruction in beagle dogs. Ten beagles were divided into two groups: group A (PCL/TCP/bdECM + ADSC injection; n = 5) and group B (PCL/TCP/bdECM; n = 5). The results were analyzed four and eight weeks after intervention. Computed tomography (CT) findings showed that group A had more diffuse osteoblast tissue than group B. Evidence of infection or immune rejection was not detected following histological examination. Goldner trichrome (G/T) staining revealed rich ossification in scaffold pores. ColI, Osteocalcin, and Runx2 gene expressions were determined using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Group A showed greater expression of these genes. Through Western blotting, group A showed a greater expression of genes that encode ColI, Osteocalcin, and Runx2 proteins. In conclusion, intervention group A, in which the beagles received the additional ADSC injection together with the 3D-printed PCL/TCP coated with bdECM, showed improved mandibular ossification in and around the pores of the scaffold.

AB  - Infections with human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) are often asymptomatic in healthy adults but can be severe in people with a compromised immune system. While several studies have demonstrated associations between cardiovascular disease in older adults and HCMV seropositivity, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. We review evidence published within the last 5 years establishing how HCMV can contribute directly and indirectly to the development and progression of atherosclerotic plaques. We also discuss associations between HCMV infection and cardiovascular outcomes in populations with a high or very high burden of HCMV, including patients with renal or autoimmune disease, transplant recipients, and people living with HIV.

AB  - The aim of the present study is to evaluate the kinetics of CD34(+) cells and investigate the potential modulation of CD44 and CD31 expression on CD34(+) cells during continuous i.v. administration of G-CSF, thus to elucidate the possible mechanism of peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) mobilization. Fifteen healthy donors were enrolled in this study. G-CSF (10 microg/kg/day) was administered for four consecutive days through continuous 24-h i.v. infusion. For measurement of complete blood counts, CD34(+) cell levels and their expression of CD44 and CD31, PB sampling was performed immediately before the administration of G-CSF (steady-state) and after 4, 8, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h of G-CSF administration. The percentage and absolute number of CD34(+) cells significantly increased at day 3 (0. 55 +/- 0.09%, 51.12 +/- 24.83 x 10(3)/ml) and day 4 (0.47 +/- 0.09%, 46.66 +/- 24.93 x 10(3)/ml), compared to the steady-state level (0. 06 +/- 0.09%, 2.03 +/- 5.69 x 10(3)/ml). At day 3 to day 5 following the onset of G-CSF administration, a strong decrease of CD44 and CD31 expression was observed on mobilized CD34(+) cells compared to controls: the relative fluorescence intensity of CD44 and CD31 was, respectively, 50%-70% and 40%-90% lower than that of controls. We conclude that continuous i.v. administration of G-CSF apparently results in more rapid mobilization of CD34(+) cells, and downregulation of CD44 and CD31 on CD34(+) cells is likely to be involved in the mobilization of PBPC after treatment with G-CSF.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Alzheimer disease (AD) brains are deficient in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which regulates synaptic plasticity and memory. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are ∼22-nucleotide small noncoding RNAs that control a variety of physiological and disease processes. Here, we show that miR-206 regulates BDNF and memory function in AD mice. METHODS: Expression of miRNAs was analyzed in Tg2576 AD transgenic mice and human AD brain samples. Regulation of BDNF by a selected miRNA was validated by in silico prediction, target gene luciferase assay, and dendritic spine responses in neurons. AM206, a neutralizing inhibitor of miR-206 (antagomir), was injected into the third ventricle of Tg2576 mice, after which memory function, synaptogenesis, neurogenesis, and target gene expression were assessed. For noninvasive delivery, antagomirs were administered intranasally. RESULTS: The brains of Tg2576 mice and the temporal cortex of human AD brains had increased levels of miR-206. This miRNA targeted BDNF transcripts, and AM206 prevented the detrimental effects of amyloid-β42 on BDNF and dendritic spine degeneration in Tg2576 neurons. Injection of AM206 into the cerebral ventricles of AD mice increased the brain levels of BDNF and improved their memory function. In parallel, AM206 enhanced the hippocampal synaptic density and neurogenesis. Furthermore, intranasally administered AM206 also reached the brain and increased BDNF levels and memory function in AD mice. INTERPRETATION: Our findings demonstrate a novel miRNA-dependent regulation of BDNF in AD and suggest possible therapeutic approaches, such as noninvasive intranasal delivery of AM206.

AB  - Cascade hydroxyl radical generating hydrogel reactor structures including a chemotherapeutic agent are invented for multiple treatment of breast cancer. Glucose oxidase (GOx) and cupric sulfate (Cu) are introduced for transforming accumulated glucose (in cancer cells) to hydroxyl radicals for starvation/chemodynamic therapy. Cu may also suppress cancer cell growth via cuproptosis-mediated cell death. Berberine hydrochloride (BER) is engaged as a chemotherapeutic agent in the hydrogel reactor for combining with starvation/chemodynamic/cuproptosis therapeutic modalities. Moreover, Cu is participated as a gel crosslinker by coordinating with catechol groups in hyaluronic acid-dopamine (HD) polymer. Controlling viscoelasticity of hydrogel reactor can extend the retention time following local injection and provide sustained drug release patterns. Low biodegradation rate of designed HD/BER/GOx/Cu hydrogel can reduce dosing frequency in local cancer therapy and avoid invasiveness-related inconveniences. Especially, it is anticipated that HD/BER/GOx/Cu hydrogel system can be applied for reducing size of breast cancer prior to surgery as well as tumor growth suppression in clinical application.

AB  - Researchers across a wide array of disciplines are interested in finding the most influential subjects in a network. In a network setting, intervention effects and health outcomes can spill over from one node to another through network ties, and influential subjects are expected to have a greater impact than others. For this reason, network research in public health has attempted to maximize health and behavioral changes by intervening on a subset of influential subjects. Although influence is often defined only implicitly in most of the literature, the operative notion of influence is inherently causal in many cases: influential subjects are those we should intervene on to achieve the greatest overall effect across the entire network. In this work, we define a causal notion of influence using potential outcomes. We review existing influence measures, such as node centrality, that largely rely on the particular features of the network structure and/or on certain diffusion models that predict the pattern of information or diseases spreads through network ties. We provide simulation studies to demonstrate when popular centrality measures can agree with our causal measure of influence. As an illustrative example, we apply several popular centrality measures to the HIV risk network in the Transmission Reduction Intervention Project and demonstrate the assumptions under which each centrality can represent the causal influence of each participant in the study.

AB  - We reported previously that the intracerebroventricular streptozotocin (icv-STZ)-treated cynomolgus monkey showed regionally specific glucose hypometabolism in FDG-PET imaging, similar to that observed in the early stages of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (sAD). However, further pathological analyses of this model at the molecular level are needed to validate it as a feasible model for sAD. Two cynomolgus monkeys were injected with 2 mg/kg STZ into the cerebellomedullary cistern at day 1, 7 and 14. Two control monkeys were given normal saline. At 5 months after injection, the expression levels of genes encoding 9 upstream molecules in insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling and markers for 4 cell-type populations in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, posterior cingulate, precuneus, and occipital cortex of control and icv-STZ treated cynomolgus monkeys were examined. Real-time quantitative PCR analyses demonstrated that the overall mRNA expression of insulin/IGF signaling-related genes was mainly impaired in the anterior part of the cerebrum, frontal cortex, and hippocampus, similar to the early stage of sAD. The changes were accompanied by the loss of oligodendrocytes and neurons. The posterior part of the cerebrum did not show degenerative alterations. The present study provides important fundamental information on the icv-STZ monkey model for sAD. These results may help guide future studies using this model for the investigation of pathological mechanisms and the development of drugs for sAD.

AB  - The objective of this study was to explore the parenting patterns of families exposed to the fly-in-fly-out (FIFO) work pattern in raising adolescent children, and develop and test the usefulness of a parenting resource specific to this family structure. A mixed methods research design was employed using semi-structured telephone interviews and questionnaires to collect information on parental monitoring, behaviour management, relationship quality, communication strategies, and parent and adolescent mental health. Twenty-one Western Australian at-home parents with FIFO partners, 23 FIFO workers, and 41 adolescent children of FIFO parents participated in the study. Responding parents and their children were generally coping well with the challenges of the FIFO work pattern. Parenting strategies such as open and meaningful communication; family time spent together; routines; social support networks and setting boundaries were discussed as strategies that were adopted by the participants interviewed to parent their adolescent children. FIFO families face increased challenges in providing consistent parenting strategies given the cyclical presence and absence of one parent. They are typically unable to dedicate time to attending face to face or group parenting sessions and can be reluctant to ask for help when the FIFO work pattern becomes problematic. An online parenting resource provides an effective tool to communicate successful parenting strategies for FIFO families with adolescents.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: In order to provide a better understanding of the sympathetic nervous system as a negative regulator of bone status, the aim of the study was to establish the biomechanical mandible response to different doses of a β-adrenergic antagonist such as propranolol (P) in a stress-induced food restriction model of growth retardation. METHODS: Rats were assigned to eight groups: Control (C), C+P3.5 (CP3.5), C+P7 (CP7), C+P14 (CP14), NGR, NGR+P3.5 (NGRP3.5), NGR+P7 (NGRP7) and NGR+P14 (NGRP14). C, CP3.5, CP7 and CP14 rats were freely fed with the standard diet. NGR, NGRP3.5, NGRP7 and NGRP14 rats received, for 4 weeks (W4), 80% of the amount of controls food consumed. Propranolol 3.5, 7 and 14mg/kg/day was injected ip 5days per week in CP3.5 and NGRP3.5, CP7 and NGRP7, CP14 and NGRP14, respectively. At W4, zoometry, mandible morphometry, static histomorphometric and biomechanical competence were performed. RESULTS: A dose of Propranolol 7mg/kg/day induced interradicular bone volume accretion reaching a mandible stiffness according to chronological age. CONCLUSION: These findings evidenced that sympathetic nervous system activity is a negative regulator of mandible mechanical competence in the nutritional growth retardation model. Propranolol 7mg/kg/day, under the regimen usage, seems to be appropriate to blockade SNS activity on mandible mechanical performance in NGR rats, probably associated to an effect on bone mechanostat system ability to detect disuse mode as an error.

AB  - African-American men who have sex with men and women (MSMW) are among those most heavily impacted by HIV in the United States, and those who have histories of incarceration are at further risk of infection. The Men in Life Environments (MILE) HIV prevention intervention was developed to provide culturally appropriate skills-based education and support for African-American MSMW with recent histories of incarceration. The MILE's conceptual framework was informed by three theories: Theory of Reasoned Action and Planned Behavior, Critical Thinking and Cultural Affirmation Model, and Empowerment Theory. The theory-based framework posits that improving racial pride is crucial in building self-efficacy and intentions that in turn promote health-protective behaviors. Therefore, our study aimed to assess whether baseline associations between racial pride and condom use self-efficacy, intentions, and behaviors among African-American MSMW with histories of incarceration align with our conceptual model. We report data on 212 participants recruited from Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department Men's Central Jail and the local community. Using structural equation modeling, we tested two separate models: one with female sexual partners and one with male sexual partners, while stratifying by participant's HIV status. Only among HIV-negative participants was greater racial pride associated with less condomless intercourse with men. In this group, greater self-efficacy and intentions-but not racial pride-predicted less condomless intercourse with women. Our findings suggest that racial pride is an important factor to address in HIV prevention interventions for post-incarcerated African-American MSMW.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Men who have sex with men (MSM) bear the greatest burden of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in every state in the U.S., but their populations are poorly defined. We estimated and compared populations of MSM in 2007 by region, state, and race/ethnicity. METHODS: We averaged findings from two statistical models we had previously developed to estimate the total state-specific percentage and number of males who were MSM. The models were based, respectively, on state-specific rural/ suburban/urban characteristics and an index using state-specific household census data on same-sex male unmarried partners. A third model, based on racial/ethnic ratios from a nationally representative behavioral survey, partitioned these statewide numbers by race/ethnicity. RESULTS: Of an estimated 7.1 million MSM residing in the U.S. in 2007, 71.4% (5.1 million) were white, 15.9% (1.1 million) were Hispanic, 8.9% (635,000) were black, 2.7% (191,000) were Asian, 0.4% (26,000) were American Indian/Alaska Native, 0.1% (6,000) were Native Hawaiian/other Pacific Islander, and 0.6% (41,000) were of multiple/unknown race/ethnicity. The overall U.S. percentage of males who were MSM (6.4%) varied from 3.3% in South Dakota to 13.2% in the District of Columbia, which we treated as a state. Estimated numbers of MSM ranged from 9,612 in Wyoming to 1,104,805 in California. CONCLUSIONS: Plausible estimates of MSM populations by state and race/ethnicity can inform and guide HIV/AIDS surveillance, allocation of resources, and advocacy. They can help in the planning, implementation, and evaluation of HIV prevention programs and other services. Using MSM numbers as denominators, estimates of population-based MSM HIV incidence, prevalence, and mortality rates could help clarify national and state-level epidemic dynamics. Until corroborated by other modeling and/or empirical research, these estimates should be used with caution.

AB  - Issues of cost and complexity have limited the study of the population sizes of men who have sex with men (MSM) and injection drug users (IDUs), two groups at clearly increased risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other acute and chronic diseases. We developed a prototypical, easily applied estimation model for these populations and applied it to Miami, Florida. This model combined HIV prevalence estimates, HIV seroprevalence rates, and census data to make plausible estimates of the number and proportion of MSM and IDUs under a number of assumptions. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of the model. The model suggests that approximately 9.5% (plausible range 7.7%-11.3%) of Miami males aged 18 years or older are MSM (point estimate, N = 76,500), and 1.4% (plausible range 0.9%-1.9%) of the total population aged 18 years or older are IDUs (point estimate, N = 23,700). Males may be about 2.5 times more likely than females to be IDUs. The estimates were reasonably robust to biases. The model was used to develop MSM and IDU population estimates in selected urban areas across Florida and should be replicable in other medium-to-large urban areas. Such estimates could be useful for behavioral surveillance and resource allocation, including enhanced targeting of community-based interventions for primary and secondary HIV prevention.

AB  - States across the U.S. lack effective ways to quantify HIV prevalence rates among men who have sex with men (MSM). We estimated population-based HIV prevalence rates among MSM in the 17 southern states by race/ethnicity. Through 2007, estimated HIV prevalence rates per 100,000 MSM ranged from 2,607.6 among white (non-Hispanic) MSM in Maryland to 41,512.9 among black (non-Hispanic) MSM in the District of Columbia. Black MSM rates significantly exceeded Hispanic and white MSM rates in each state. Significant racial/ethnic disparities in rates persisted in a sensitivity analysis examining the possibility that minority MSM populations had been underestimated in each state. Compared with black, Hispanic, and white non-MSM males, respectively, rates at the regional level were 25.2 times higher for black MSM, 43.0 times higher for Hispanic MSM, and 106.0 times higher for white MSM. State-level analysis of racial/ethnic-specific MSM HIV prevalence rates can help guide resource allocation and assist advocacy.

AB  - Data from various countries show considerable variation in the rate of spread of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) among drug injectors. Although further research is needed to predict the rate of increase of seroprevalence at Rio de Janeiro, preliminary data confirm the presence of the virus, with a seroprevalence of about 33 per cent in 1990. Issues arising from research into the probable determinants of viral spread among the thousands of drug injectors in the city are outlined in the present paper. Even before the research is completed, however, it is clear that interventions are needed to reduce further viral transmission both among drug injectors and from them to their sexual partners and offspring. Efforts should be made to prevent the population at risk from initiating the practice of drug injection, and to promote a major expansion in drug abuse treatment facilities. Drug injectors should also be encouraged to reduce the risk of their becoming infected or passing on the virus to others, through educational outreach, through the distribution of supplies that facilitate risk reduction (bleach, syringes, condoms), and through innovative approaches to behaviour change.
Data from various countries show considerable variation in the rate and extent of HIV spread among IV drug users (IVDU). More than 11,000 people have been diagnosed as having AIDS in Brazil, of whom 1700 were in Rio de Janeiro. 82 of these 1700 people were heterosexual IVDUs and 16 were homosexual or bisexual IVDUs. Although additional research is needed to predict the level and rate of increase of HIV seroprevalence in Rio de Janeiro, preliminary data suggest that as many as 33% of IVDUs in 1990 may have been HIV-seropositive. Such data clearly warrant interventions to reduce HIV transmission within this population and from them to their sex partners and offspring. This paper outlines issues arising from research into the probable determinants of viral spread among the thousands of drug injectors in the city. Efforts need to be made to prevent the population at risk from beginning to use injecting drugs and to promote a major expansion in drug abuse treatment facilities. Drug injectors should also be encouraged to reduce the risk of their becoming infected or passing the virus to others. Approaches could include educational outreach; the distribution of supplies which facilitate risk reduction such as bleach, syringes, and condoms; and innovative approaches to behavior change.

AB  - To determine risk factors for HIV-1 among drug injectors in Rio de Janeiro, where cocaine is the dominant drug of injection, subjects were recruited using the criteria and interview instrument of the World Health Organization's Cross-National Study of HIV infection and risk behaviour in injecting drug users. HIV antibody test results were derived both from serum tests and from self-reports of previous tests (documented evidence of self-reported seropositivity was required). The analytical sample consists of 123 subjects, recruited both at drug abuse treatment sites and at street locations. Of 27 subjects with both serological and self-reported antibody status data, 20 reported previous negative tests; of these three had positive sera and may have seroconverted. Seven subjects reporting prior positive serostatus all tested positive. For the 123 subjects, seroprevalence was 34%. Independent significant risk factors in multivariate logistic regression with backwards elimination are: years of injection greater than 5; being a male who has had sex with men in the previous 5 years; and not having taken deliberate steps to protect oneself against AIDS. These findings indicate that homosexual/bisexual male drug injectors may be a bridge group through which HIV is entering drug-injecting networks in Rio de Janeiro. Efforts by drug injectors to reduce their risk of infection seem to have protective effects. This underscores the importance of HIV prevention efforts aimed at drug injectors.

AB  - The simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) transmembrane (TM) protein, gp41, has multiple functions, which include anchoring the glycoprotein complex in the lipid envelope of the virus and mediating fusion of the virus and host cell membranes. Recently, a series of mutants of the SIVmac239 TM protein that have truncations at the carboxyl terminus of the membrane-spanning domain (MSD) have been characterized (J. T. West, P. Johnston, S. R. Dubay, and E. Hunter, J. Virol. 75:9601-9612, 2001). These mutants retained membrane anchorage but demonstrated reduced fusogenicity and infectivity as the MSD length was shortened. We have established a novel three-color fluorescence assay, which allows qualitative confocal and quantitative flow cytometric analyses, to further characterize the nature of the fusion defect in five of the MSD mutants: TM185, TM186, TM187, TM188, and TM189. Our analysis showed that each mutant could mediate complete lipid and aqueous dye transfer at early time points after effector and target cell mixing. No hemifusion with only lipid dye flux was detected. However, another intermediate fusion stage, which appears to involve small-fusion-pore formation that allowed small aqueous dye transfer but prevented the exchange of large cytoplasmic components, was identified infrequently in mutant-Env-expressing cell and target cell mixtures. Quantitative now cytometric analysis of these mutants demonstrated that the TM187, TM188, and TM189 mutants were significantly more fusogenic than TM185 and TM186 but remained significantly impaired compared to the wild type. Moreover, fusion efficiency showed an increased dependence on the expression level of glycoproteins, suggesting that, for these mutants, formation of an active fusion complex was an increasingly stochastic event.

AB  - PURPOSE: Investigate whether characteristics of geographic areas are associated with condomless sex and injection-related risk behavior among racial/ethnic groups of people who inject drugs (PWID) in the United States. METHODS: PWID were recruited from 19 metropolitan statistical areas for 2009 National HIV Behavioral Surveillance. Administrative data described ZIP codes, counties, and metropolitan statistical areas where PWID lived. Multilevel models, stratified by racial/ethnic groups, were used to assess relationships of place-based characteristics to condomless sex and injection-related risk behavior (sharing injection equipment). RESULTS: Among black PWID, living in the South (vs. Northeast) was associated with injection-related risk behavior (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.24, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.21-4.17; P = .011), and living in counties with higher percentages of unaffordable rental housing was associated with condomless sex (AOR = 1.02, 95% CI = 1.00-1.04; P = .046). Among white PWID, living in ZIP codes with greater access to drug treatment was negatively associated with condomless sex (AOR = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.88-1.00; P = .038). CONCLUSIONS: Policies that increase access to affordable housing and drug treatment may make environments more conducive to safe sexual behaviors among black and white PWID. Future research designed to longitudinally explore the association between residence in the south and injection-related risk behavior might identify specific place-based features that sustain patterns of injection-related risk behavior.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Housing instability has been associated with poor health outcomes among people who inject drugs (PWID). This study investigates the associations of local-level housing and economic conditions with homelessness among a large sample of PWID, which is an underexplored topic to date. METHODS: PWID in this cross-sectional study were recruited from 19 large cities in the USA as part of National HIV Behavioral Surveillance. PWID provided self-reported information on demographics, behaviours and life events. Homelessness was defined as residing on the street, in a shelter, in a single room occupancy hotel, or in a car or temporarily residing with friends or relatives any time in the past year. Data on county-level rental housing unaffordability and demand for assisted housing units, and ZIP code-level gentrification (eg, index of percent increases in non-Hispanic white residents, household income, gross rent from 1990 to 2009) and economic deprivation were collected from the US Census Bureau and Department of Housing and Urban Development. Multilevel models evaluated the associations of local economic and housing characteristics with homelessness. RESULTS: Sixty percent (5394/8992) of the participants reported homelessness in the past year. The multivariable model demonstrated that PWID living in ZIP codes with higher levels of gentrification had higher odds of homelessness in the past year (gentrification: adjusted OR=1.11, 95% CI=1.04 to 1.17). CONCLUSIONS: Additional research is needed to determine the mechanisms through which gentrification increases homelessness among PWID to develop appropriate community-level interventions.

AB  - Racial/ethnic homophily in sexual partnerships (partners share the same race/ethnicity) has been associated with racial/ethnic disparities in HIV. Structural racism may partly determine racial/ethnic homophily in sexual partnerships. This study estimated associations of racial/ethnic concentration and mortgage discrimination against Black and Latino residents with racial/ethnic homophily in sexual partnerships among 7847 people who inject drugs (PWID) recruited from 19 US cities to participate in CDC's National HIV Behavioral Surveillance. Racial/ethnic concentration was defined by two measures that respectively compared ZIP code-level concentrations of Black residents to White residents and Latino residents to White residents, using the Index of Concentration at the Extremes. Mortgage discrimination was defined by two measures that respectively compared county-level mortgage loan denial among Black applicants to White applicants and mortgage loan denial among Latino applicants to White applicants, with similar characteristics (e.g., income, loan amount). Multilevel logistic regression models were used to estimate associations. Interactions of race/ethnicity with measures of racial/ethnic concentration and mortgage discrimination were added to the final multivariable model and decomposed into race/ethnicity-specific estimates. In the final multivariable model, among Black PWID, living in ZIP codes with higher concentrations of Black vs. White residents and counties with higher mortgage discrimination against Black residents was associated with higher odds of homophily. Living in counties with higher mortgage discrimination against Latino residents was associated with lower odds of homophily among Black PWID. Among Latino PWID, living in ZIP codes with higher concentrations of Latino vs. White residents and counties with higher mortgage discrimination against Latino residents was associated with higher odds of homophily. Living in counties with higher mortgage discrimination against Black residents was associated with lower odds of homophily among Latino PWID. Among White PWID, living in ZIP codes with higher concentrations of Black or Latino residents vs. White residents was associated with lower odds of homophily, but living in counties with higher mortgage discrimination against Black residents was associated with higher odds of homophily. Racial/ethnic segregation may partly drive same race/ethnicity sexual partnering among PWID. Future empirical evidence linking these associations directly or indirectly (via place-level mediators) to HIV/STI transmission will determine how eliminating discriminatory housing policies impact HIV/STI transmission.

AB  - Needle sharing has long been recognized as a primary route of HIV infection. However, recent research has shown that HIV antibody is also detectable in injection supplies other than needles. In this study we tested frequency of attendance at a Providence, Rhode Island, needle exchange program (NEP) as a correlate of injection risk indicators including not just sharing needles but also sharing cookers, sharing cotton filters, cleaning the skin before injecting, and using bleach as a needle disinfectant. Results showed that drug users who attended the NEP less frequently were more likely to report needle sharing, less likely to report always cleaning their skin, and more likely to report sharing cookers. The Providence NEP is one at which alcohol swabs and cookers are distributed along with clean needles. Our results suggest that NEPs represent a valuable and underexploited opportunity to promote risk reduction efforts beyond the avoidance of needle sharing. NEPs should be distributing risk reduction supplies in addition to clean needles and should adopt strategies (e.g., outreach and more days/hours of operation) to encourage frequent attendance.

AB  - This article describes the secondary syringe exchange (SSE) practices of injection drug users (IDUs) attending 23 syringe exchange programs (SEPs) in the state of California during 2002 (n=539). The sample was primarily heroin injecting, about two thirds male, half White and half other racial/ethnic groups. Participants were interviewed with a structured questionnaire that included items on sociodemographic factors, drug use practices, sexual practices, use of SEP and other social services, and satisfaction with SEP services. Interviews lasted about 30 minutes. SSE was highly prevalent: 75% of IDUs reported participating in SSE in the 6 months before interview. Program characteristics, such as legal status, SSE policy, and exchange policy, did not affect the prevalence of SSE among SEP clients. Infectious disease risk behaviors were significantly more common among SSE participants than nonparticipants. SSE participants were more likely to share syringes (p<.001) and cookers (p<.001) in the previous 6 months. SSE was significantly associated with being stuck with another person's syringe (needle-stick), a little-discussed "occupational hazard" of this practice. In multivariate analysis, the adjusted odds ratio of needle-stick among SSE participants was 2.8 (95% confidence interval, 1.3, 6.0). The high prevalence of SSE and the infectious disease risk associated with it warrant additional research to determine the causality of these associations. In the interim, SEPs should consider reinforcing HIV prevention education messages and training IDUs who engage in SSE in safe handling of biohazardous materials.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of a gp120 binding, non-cytotoxic soluble analogue of the glycosphingolipid (GSL), globotriaosyl ceramide (Gb3) on HIV infection in vitro. DESIGN: HIV-1(IIIB) (X4 virus) infection in Jurkat and phytohaemagglutinin (PHA)/interleukin-2 (IL2) activated, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and HIV-1(Ba-L) (R5 virus) infection of PHA activated PBMC in vitro were assessed. We monitored cell surface markers, cell viability, and viral/host cell morphology to eliminate pleiotropic effects. Viral-host cell fusion was measured to further address any inhibitory mechanism. METHODS: HIV infection was monitored by p24(gag) ELISA. CD4, CCR5, CXCR4 and apoptosis were determined by fluorescent antibody cell sorting. A model fusion system comprising a cell line transfected with either CD4 and CXCR4 or CCR5, cocultured with a cell line expressing gp120 from either X4-, R5-tropic HIV-1 or HIV-2 virions, was used. PHA/IL2 activated PBMC GSL synthesis was monitored by metabolic radiolabelling. RESULTS: AdamantylGb3 blocked X4 and R5 virus infection with a 50% inhibitory concentration of approximately 150 microM. A reverse transcriptase and a protease-resistant X4 HIV-1 strain retained adamantylGb3 sensitivity. AdamantylGb3 had minimal effect on cell viability. Treated Jurkat cells showed a small increase in CCR5/CXCR4 expression and a slight, transient CD4 down-regulation, which was probably not related to the mechanism of inhibition. Electron microscopy showed normal viral and host cell morphology following adamantylGb3 treatment, and viral entry was blocked. AdamantylGb3 was able to prevent virus-host cell fusion irrespective of HIV strain or chemokine receptor preference. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that adamantylGb3 may provide a new basis for blocking HIV infections, irrespective of HIV envelope/chemokine co-receptor preference or resistance to other therapeutics.

AB  - From 1982 to 1983 we received reports of a neurologic illness characterized by a symmetric descending paralysis in six drug abusers from widely separated geographic areas. Botulism was confirmed in two patients; type B botulinal toxin was found and Clostridium botulinum was isolated from a small abscess in one, and type A botulinal toxin was found in the serum of the other. The clinical illness in the remaining four patients, although not laboratory confirmed, was also compatible with botulism. None of the patients had histories suggestive of foodborne botulism, and wound botulism was suspected as the cause of illness. There are several reports of tetanus associated with parenteral drug abuse; wound botulism is another toxin-mediated clostridial infection that may occur as a complication of chronic drug abuse.

AB  - Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) was discovered in the early 1980s when the virus had already established a pandemic. For at least three decades the epidemic in the Western World has been dominated by subtype B infections, as part of a sub-epidemic that traveled from Africa through Haiti to United States. However, the pattern of the subsequent spread still remains poorly understood. Here we analyze a large dataset of globally representative HIV-1 subtype B strains to map their spread around the world over the last 50years and describe significant spread patterns. We show that subtype B travelled from North America to Western Europe in different occasions, while Central/Eastern Europe remained isolated for the most part of the early epidemic. Looking with more detail in European countries we see that the United Kingdom, France and Switzerland exchanged viral isolates with non-European countries than with European ones. The observed pattern is likely to mirror geopolitical landmarks in the post-World War II era, namely the rise and the fall of the Iron Curtain and the European colonialism. In conclusion, HIV-1 spread through specific migration routes which are consistent with geopolitical factors that affected human activities during the last 50years, such as migration, tourism and trade. Our findings support the argument that epidemic control policies should be global and incorporate political and socioeconomic factors.

AB  - Given globalization and other social phenomena, controlling the spread of infectious diseases has become an imperative public health priority. A plethora of interventions that in theory can mitigate the spread of pathogens have been proposed and applied. Evaluating the effectiveness of such interventions is costly and in many circumstances unrealistic. Most important, the community effect (i.e., the ability of the intervention to minimize the spread of the pathogen from people who received the intervention to other community members) can rarely be evaluated. Here we propose a study design that can build and evaluate evidence in support of the community effect of an intervention. The approach exploits molecular evolutionary dynamics of pathogens in order to track new infections as having arisen from either a control or an intervention group. It enables us to evaluate whether an intervention reduces the number and length of new transmission chains in comparison with a control condition, and thus lets us estimate the relative decrease in new infections in the community due to the intervention. We provide as an example one working scenario of a way the approach can be applied with a simulation study and associated power calculations.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: The follow-up schedule for individuals with eyes treated with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents for proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) requires that patients return frequently for monitoring and repeated treatment. The likelihood that a patient will comply should be a consideration in choosing a treatment approach. OBJECTIVE: To describe completion of scheduled examinations among participants assigned to intravitreous injections of ranibizumab for PDR in a multicenter randomized clinical trial. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This post hoc analysis evaluates data from a randomized clinical trial conducted at 55 US sites among 305 adults with proliferative diabetic retinopathy enrolled between February and December 2012. Both eyes were enrolled for 89 participants (1 eye to each study group), with a total of 394 study eyes. The final 2-year visit was completed in January 2015. Data were analyzed from April 2019 to July 2021. INTERVENTIONS: Ranibizumab injections for PDR or macular edema. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: A long lapse in care of 8 or more weeks past a scheduled examination, dropout from follow-up, visual acuity at 5 years. RESULTS: Among 170 participants, the median age was 51 years, and 44.7% were female. Through 5 years of follow-up, 94 of 170 participants (55.3%) had 1 or more long lapse in care. Median time to the first long lapse was 210 weeks, and 69 of 94 participants (73.4%) returned for examination after the first long lapse. Fifty of 170 participants (29.4%) dropped out of follow-up by 5 years. Among the 120 participants who completed the 5-year examination, median change from baseline in visual acuity was -2 letters for participants who had 1 or more long lapse compared with +5 letters for those without a long lapse (P = .02). After multivariable adjustment, the odds ratio (95% CI) for baseline associations with 1 or more long lapse was 1.21 (1.03-1.43) for each 5-letter decrement in visual acuity score, 2.19 (1.09-4.38) for neovascularization of the disc and elsewhere, and 3.48 (1.38-8.78) for no prior laser treatment for diabetic macular edema. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Over 5 years, approximately half of the participants assigned to ranibizumab for PDR had a long lapse in care despite substantial effort by the DRCR Retina Network to facilitate timely completion of examinations. The likelihood of a long lapse in care during long-term follow-up needs to be considered when choosing treatment for PDR. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01489189.

AB  - We report here the results of a survey of 308 intravenous drug abusers recruited from hospital-based methadone maintenance or drug detoxification programmes located in Manhattan, New York City. Complete interviews and serological analyses for antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) using both enzyme-linked immunosorbent and Western blot assays were obtained from 290 (94%) of the subjects. HIV antibodies were found by both assays in 147 (50.7%) of the tested subjects; conflicting results were found in three (1%) of the subjects; and negative results on both tests were found in 140 (48.3%) of the subjects. Logistic regression analysis identified significant relative risks for HIV infection associated with the frequency of drug injection and the proportion of injections in 'shooting galleries'. Additional risk among men was associated with a history of homosexual relations. Traditional efforts taken by subjects to clean syringes between uses, such as washing with water or alcohol, showed no evidence of being protective. Programmes aimed at prevention of HIV infection should focus on reducing use of shooting galleries and sharing of needles and syringes as well as reducing intravenous drug abuse generally.

AB  - Intravenous (IV) users of illicit drugs have accounted for 17% of AIDS cases seen in the United States. Previous research has shown that more than half of IV drug abusers entering a drug detoxification program in New York City had serologic evidence of exposure to the virus believed to cause AIDS. Spread of AIDS among drug abusers presumably occurs by transmission of the virus via shared needles, works, or drug-containing solutions. Secondary spread of AIDS from IV drug abusers to others may occur by venereal transmission or by perinatal transmission to infants. In this article, relevant characteristics of the AIDS epidemic are presented to assist the staff of drug treatment programs in their work with IV drug abusers. Suggestions regarding the education of drug treatment personnel and the dissemination of information about AIDS to drug abusers and their families are offered. Fact sheets on AIDS for drug treatment and prison staff, and for drug abusers with and without the disease are presented. Finally, possible approaches to the prevention of AIDS in drug users are discussed.

AB  - In the United States, people who inject drugs continue to be at greatly increased risk of HIV infection. To estimate the effectiveness of various prevention scenarios, we modeled HIV transmission in a dynamic network of drug users and people who did not use drugs that was based on the New York Metropolitan Statistical Area population. We compared the projected HIV incidence in 2020 and 2040 if current approaches continue to be used to the incidence if one or more of the following hypothetical interventions were applied: increased HIV testing, improved access to substance abuse treatment, increased use of needle and syringe programs, scaled-up treatment as prevention, and a "high impact" combination scenario, consisting of all of the strategies listed above. No strategy completely eliminated HIV transmission. The high-impact combination strategy produced the largest decrease in HIV incidence-a 62 percent reduction compared to the status quo. Our results suggest that increased resources for and investments in multiple HIV prevention approaches will be required to eliminate HIV transmission among people who inject drugs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: HIV transmission among injecting and non-injecting drug users (IDU, NIDU) is a significant public health problem. Continuing propagation in endemic settings and emerging regional outbreaks have indicated the need for comprehensive and coordinated HIV prevention. We describe the development of a conceptual framework and calibration of an agent-based model (ABM) to examine how combinations of interventions may reduce and potentially eliminate HIV transmission among drug-using populations. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A multidisciplinary team of researchers from epidemiology, sociology, geography, and mathematics developed a conceptual framework based on prior ethnographic and epidemiologic research. An ABM was constructed and calibrated through an iterative design and verification process. In the model, "agents" represent IDU, NIDU, and non-drug users who interact with each other and within risk networks, engaging in sexual and, for IDUs, injection-related risk behavior over time. Agents also interact with simulated HIV prevention interventions (e.g., syringe exchange programs, substance abuse treatment, HIV testing) and initiate antiretroviral treatment (ART) in a stochastic manner. The model was constructed to represent the New York metropolitan statistical area (MSA) population, and calibrated by comparing output trajectories for various outcomes (e.g., IDU/NIDU prevalence, HIV prevalence and incidence) against previously validated MSA-level data. The model closely approximated HIV trajectories in IDU and NIDU observed in New York City between 1992 and 2002, including a linear decrease in HIV prevalence among IDUs. Exploratory results are consistent with empirical studies demonstrating that the effectiveness of a combination of interventions, including syringe exchange expansion and ART provision, dramatically reduced HIV prevalence among IDUs during this time period. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Complex systems models of adaptive HIV transmission dynamics can be used to identify potential collective benefits of hypothetical combination prevention interventions. Future work will seek to inform novel strategies that may lead to more effective and equitable HIV prevention strategies for drug-using populations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite high hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment rates, HCV incidence among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected men who have sex with men (HIV-infected MSM) in Germany rose before HCV direct-acting antivirals (DAAs). We model what intervention can achieve the World Health Organization (WHO) elimination target of an 80% reduction in HCV incidence by 2030 among HIV-infected MSM in Berlin. METHODS: An HCV transmission model among HIV-diagnosed MSM was calibrated to Berlin (rising HCV incidence and high rates of HCV testing and treatment). We modeled the HCV incidence among HIV-diagnosed MSM in Berlin until 2030 (relative to 2015 WHO baseline) under scenarios of DAA scale-up with or without behavior change (among HIV-diagnosed MSM and/or all MSM). RESULTS: Continuing current treatment rates will marginally reduce the HCV incidence among HIV-diagnosed MSM in Berlin by 2030. Scaling up DAA treatment rates, beginning in 2018, to 100% of newly diagnosed HCV infections within 3 months of diagnosis and 25% each year of previously diagnosed and untreated HCV infections could reduce the HCV incidence by 61% (95% confidence interval, 55.4%-66.7%) by 2030. The WHO target would likely be achieved by combining DAA scale-up with a 40% reduction in HCV transmission among HIV-diagnosed MSM and a 20% reduction among HIV-undiagnosed or HIV-uninfected MSM. DISCUSSION: HCV elimination among HIV-infected MSM in Berlin likely requires combining DAA scale-up with moderately effective behavioral interventions to reduce risk among all MSM.

AB  - People who inject drugs (PWID) and HIV-infected men who have sex with men (MSM) are key risk groups for HCV transmission. Mathematical modeling studies can help elucidate what level and combination of prevention intervention scale-up is required to control or eliminate epidemics among these key populations. We discuss the evidence surrounding HCV prevention interventions and provide an overview of the mathematical modeling literature projecting the impact of scaled-up HCV prevention among PWID and HIV-infected MSM. Harm reduction interventions, such as opiate substitution therapy and needle and syringe programs, are effective in reducing HCV incidence among PWID. Modeling and limited empirical data indicate that HCV treatment could additionally be used for prevention. No studies have evaluated the effectiveness of behavior change interventions to reduce HCV incidence among MSM, but existing interventions to reduce HIV risk could be effective. Mathematical modeling and empirical data indicate that scale-up of harm reduction could reduce HCV transmission, but in isolation is unlikely to eliminate HCV among PWID. By contrast, elimination is possibly achievable through combination scale-up of harm reduction and HCV treatment. Similarly, among HIV-infected MSM, eliminating the emerging epidemics will likely require HCV treatment scale-up in combination with additional interventions to reduce HCV-related risk behaviors. In summary, elimination of HCV will likely require combination prevention efforts among both PWID and HIV-infected MSM populations. Further empirical research is required to validate HCV treatment as prevention among these populations, and to identify effective behavioral interventions to reduce HCV incidence among MSM.

AB  - Latinos in the United States are an ethnically diverse group disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS. We describe HIV seroprevalence, HIV risk behaviors and utilization of health services among Mexican American injection drug users (IDUs) in California (n = 286) and compare them to White (n = 830) and African American (n = 314) IDUs. Study participants were recruited from syringe exchange programs (n = 24) in California. HIV seroprevalence among Mexican Americans (0.5%) was dramatically lower than Whites (5%) and African Americans (8%). Mexican Americans reported fewer sex-related risks than Whites and African Americans though injection-related risks remained high. Compared to Whites, Mexican Americans were more likely to participate in drug treatment during a 6 month period (AOR 1.5, 95% CI 1.1, 2.0) but less likely to receive any health care (AOR 0.6, 95% CI 0.5, 0.8). Exploring cultural and structural factors among Mexican American IDUs may offer new insights into how to maintain low rates of HIV seroprevalence and reduce barriers to health care utilization.

AB  - Legislation passed in 2000 allowed syringe exchange programs (SEPs) in California to operate legally if local jurisdictions declare a local HIV public health emergency. Nonetheless, even in locales where SEPs are legal, the possession of drug paraphernalia, including syringes, remained illegal. The objective of this paper is to examine the association between the legal status of SEPs and individual arrest or citation for drug paraphernalia among injection drug users (IDUs) in California from 2001 to 2003. Using data from three annual cross-sections (2001-03) of IDUs attending 24 SEPs in 16 California counties (N = 1,578), we found that overall, 14% of IDUs in our sample reported arrest or citation for paraphernalia in the 6 months before the interview. Further analysis found that 17% of IDUs attending a legal SEP (defined at the county level) reported arrest or citation for drug paraphernalia compared to 10% of IDUs attending an illegal SEP (p = 0.001). In multivariate analysis, the adjusted odds ratio of arrest or citation for drug paraphernalia was 1.6 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.2, 2.3] for IDUs attending legal SEPs compared to IDUs attending illegal SEPs, after controlling for race/ethnicity, age, homelessness, illegal income, injection of amphetamines, years of injection drug use, frequency of SEP use, and number of needles received at last visit. IDUs attending SEPs with legal status may be more visible to police, and hence, more subject to arrest or citation for paraphernalia. These findings suggest that legislative efforts to decriminalize the operation of SEPs without concurrent decriminalization of syringe possession may result in higher odds of arrest among SEP clients, with potentially deleterious implications for the health and well-being of IDUs. More comprehensive approaches to removing barriers to accessing sterile syringes are needed if our public health goals for reducing new HIV/HCV infections are to be obtained.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study examined HIV prevalence and risk behaviors among male injection drug users (IDUs) who have sex with men and among other male IDUs. METHODS: Male IDUs were interviewed and tested for HIV at a detoxification clinic during 1990 to 1994 and 1995 to 1999. Analyses compared male IDUs who do and do not have sex with men within and between periods. RESULTS: Initially, HIV seroprevalence and risk behaviors were higher among IDUs who have sex with men. Seroprevalence (initially 60.5% vs 48.3%) declined approximately 15% in both groups, remaining higher among those who have sex with men. Generally, injection prevalence, but not sexual risk behaviors, declined. CONCLUSIONS: Male IDUs who have sex with men are more likely to engage in higher-risk behaviors and to be HIV infected. Improved intervention approaches for male IDUs who have sex with men are needed.

AB  - Leptin is an adipocyte-derived hormone that controls food intake and reproductive and immune functions in rodents. In uncontrolled human studies, low leptin levels are associated with impaired immune responses and reduced T-cell counts; however, the effects of leptin replacement on the adaptive immune system have not yet been reported in the context of randomized, controlled studies and/or in conditions of chronic acquired leptin deficiency. To address these questions, we performed a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of recombinant methionyl-human leptin (metreleptin) administration in replacement doses in women experiencing the female triad (hypothalamic amenorrhea) with acquired chronic hypoleptinemia induced by negative energy balance. Metreleptin restored both CD4(+) T-cell counts and their in vitro proliferative responses in these women. These changes were accompanied by a transcriptional signature in which genes relevant to cell survival and hormonal response were up-regulated, and apoptosis genes were down-regulated in circulating immune cells. We also observed that signaling pathways involved in cell growth/survival/proliferation, such as the STAT3, AMPK, mTOR, ERK1/2, and Akt pathways, were activated directly by acute in vivo metreleptin administration in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and CD4(+) T-cells both from subjects with chronic hypoleptinemia and from normoleptinemic, lean female subjects. Our data show that metreleptin administration, in doses that normalize circulating leptin levels, induces transcriptional changes, activates intracellular signaling pathways, and restores CD4(+) T-cell counts. Thus, metreleptin may prove to be a safe and effective therapy for selective CD4(+) T-cell immune reconstitution in hypoleptinemic states such as tuberculosis and HIV infection in which CD4(+) T cells are reduced.

AB  - OBJETIVO: Desde principios de los noventa, en la ciudad de Nueva York se han implementado con éxito programas para reducir la incidencia del virus de la inmunodeficiencia humana (VIH) y, en menor medida, del virus de la hepatitis C (VHC). A pesar de ello, aproximadamente el 70% de los usuario de drogas inyectables (UDI) están infectados por el VHC. Queremos investigar cómo el 30% restante se las ha arreglado para no infectarse. El Staying safe (nombre original del estudio) explora los comportamientos y mecanismos que ayudan a evitar la infección por el VHC y el VIH a largo plazo. MATERIAL Y M#ENTITYSTARTX000E9;TODOS: Hemos utilizado el concepto de «desviación positiva» aplicado en otros campos de salud pública. Estudiamos las estrategias, prácticas y tácticas de prevención de aquellos UDI que, viviendo en contextos de alta prevalencia, se mantienen sin infectar por VIH y el VHC, a pesar de haberse inyectado heroína durante años. Los resultados preliminares presentados en este artículo incluyen el análisis de las entrevistas realizadas a 25 UDI (17 doble negativos, 3 doble positivos y 5 con infección por el VHC y sin infección por el VIH). Se usaron entrevistas semiestructuradas que exploraban con detalle la historia de vida de los sujetos, incluyendo su consumo de drogas, redes sociales, contacto con instituciones, relaciones sexuales y estrategias de protección y vigilancia. RESULTADOS: La intencionalidad es importante para no infectarse, especialmente durante períodos de involución (períodos donde hay un deterioro económico y/o social que llevan al que se inyecta a situaciones de mayor riesgo). Presentamos tres dimensiones independientes de intencionalidad que conllevan comportamientos que pueden ayudar a prevenir la infección: a) evitar «el mono» (síntomas de abstención) asegurando el acceso a la droga; b) «llevarlo bien» para no convertirse en un junkie y así evitar la «muerte social» y la falta de acceso a los recursos, y c) seguir sin infectarse por el VIH (sólo un doble negativo tuvo un amplio conocimiento sobre la hepatitis C). Estas intencionalidades no son mutuamente excluyentes. La presencia de varias refuerza la puesta en práctica a diario de comportamientos que pueden ayudar al que se inyecta a mantenerse libre de infecciones durante años. Algunas prácticas que hemos identificado se implementan en grupo y se comunican de UDI a UDI, de esta manera se extienden entre algunas redes sociales de UDI. CONCLUSIONES: Los UDI que permanecen sin infectarse planean e implementan estrategias de prevención en circunstancias donde otros UDI aplican prácticas de riesgo. El mantenimiento de la no infección no es, por lo tanto, un resultado del azar, sino más bien el resultado del esfuerzo (agencia) de los UDI. Investigar y extender estas estrategias y tácticas a través de programas de prevención podría contribuir a la prevención del VIH y el VHC.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The social networks of people who inject drugs (PWID) have long been studied to understand disease transmission dynamics and social influences on risky practices. We illustrate how PWID can be active agents promoting HIV, HCV, and overdose prevention. RECENT FINDINGS: We assessed drug users' connections and interactions with others at risk for HIV/HCV in three cities: New York City (NYC), USA (n = 539); Pereira, Colombia (n = 50); and St. Petersburg, Russia (n = 49). In all three cities, the majority of participants' network members were of a similar age as themselves, yet connections across age groups were also present. In NYC, knowing any opioid user(s) older than 29 was associated with testing HCV-positive. In NYC and St. Petersburg, a large proportion of PWID engaged in intravention activities to support safer injection and overdose prevention; in Pereira, PWID injected, had sex, and interacted with other key groups at risk. People who use drugs can be active players in HIV/HCV and overdose risk- reduction; their networks provide them with ample opportunities to disseminate harm reduction knowledge, strategies, and norms to others at risk. Local communities could augment prevention programming by empowering drug users to be allies in the fight against HIV and facilitating their pre-existing health-protective actions.

AB  - AIM: Evidence is emerging that prescription opioid (PO) injection is associated with increased health risks. This mixed-methods study compares the mechanics of PO and heroin injection and examines the demographic and drug-related correlates of lifetime PO injection in a sample of young people who inject drugs (PWID) in New York City (NYC). METHODS: Qualitative analysis of 46 semi-structured interviews with young adult opioid users ages 18-32. Interview segments describing PO injection were analyzed for common themes. Quantitative analysis of structured interviews with 539 young adult opioid users ages 18-29 recruited via respondent-driven sampling (RDS). Analyses are based on the subsample of 353 participants (65%) who reported having ever injected drugs. All variables were assessed via self-report, except hepatitis C virus status, which was established via rapid antibody testing. RESULTS: Participants described injecting POs and reported that preparing abuse-deterrent pills for injection is especially cumbersome, requiring extended manipulation and large amounts of water. Injecting POs, in contrast to injecting heroin, requires repeated injections per injection episode. Among RDS-recruited participants, the majority of injectors reported injecting POs, sporadically (33%) or regularly (26%), but often infrequently (≤ 7 days/month). In separate multivariable analyses controlling for syringe- and cooker-sharing, ever injecting POs was a significant predictor of testing HCV antibody-positive (AOR = 2.97) and lifetime experience of non-fatal overdose (AOR = 2.51). Ever injecting POs was independently associated with lifetime homelessness (AOR = 2.93) and having grown up in a middle-income ($51,000-100,000/year vs. ≤ $50,000/year; AOR = 1.86) or a high-income household (> $100,000/year vs. ≤ $50,000/year; AOR = 2.54). CONCLUSIONS: Even in an urban environment like NYC with widespread heroin access, most young PWID have injected POs, although less frequently than heroin. PO injection involves practices that are known to increase risk for blood-borne viral infection (e.g., repeated injections) and predicted testing HCV-positive, as well as overdose. PO injection may also serve as a marker for a subgroup of PWID at elevated risk for multiple drug use-related comorbidities. Programs that provide prevention services to PWID need to tailor harm reduction measures and messaging to the specific practices and harms associated with the injection of POs.

AB  - This pilot study explores the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of the Staying Safe Intervention, an innovative, strengths-based program to facilitate prevention of infection with the human immunodeficiency virus and with the hepatitis C virus among people who inject drugs (PWID). The authors explored changes in the intervention's two primary endpoints: (a) frequency and amount of drug intake, and (b) frequency of risky injection practices. We also explored changes in hypothesized mediators of intervention efficacy: planning skills, motivation/self-efficacy to inject safely, skills to avoid PWID-associated stigma, social support, drug-related withdrawal symptoms, and injection network size and risk norms. A 1-week, five-session intervention (10 hours total) was evaluated using a pre- versus 3-month posttest design. Fifty-one participants completed pre- and posttest assessments. Participants reported significant reductions in drug intake and injection-related risk behavior. Participants also reported significant increases in planning skills, motivation/self-efficacy, and stigma management strategies, while reducing their exposure to drug withdrawal episodes and risky injection networks.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Heroin production in Colombia has increased dramatically in recent decades, and some studies point to an increase in local heroin use since the mid-1990s. Despite this rapid increase, little is known about the effects of these activities on heroin injection within Colombia. One of the biggest concerns surrounding heroin injection is the potential spread of HIV through drug user networks. OBJECTIVES: This article examines injection risk behaviors among heroin injectors in the Colombian cities of Medellín and Pereira to explore the implications for possible increased HIV transmission within this group. METHODS: A cross-sectional study used respondent-driving sampling to recruit a sample of 540 people who inject drugs (PWID) over 18 years of age (Medellín: n = 242, Pereira: n = 298). Structured interviews with each participant were conducted using the World Health Organization Drug Injection Study Phase II Survey. An HIV test was also administered. RESULTS: Information regarding the socio-demographics, injection drug use, HIV risk and transmission behaviors, injection risk management, and HIV knowledge and prevalence of participants are reported. The study identified many young, newly initiated injectors who engage in risky injection practices. The study also found that HIV prevalence is fairly low among participants (2.7%). CONCLUSIONS/IMPORTANCE: Findings indicate a potential risk for the spread of HIV among PWID in Colombia given their widespread sharing practices, high rate of new injector initiation, and unsafe syringe cleaning practices. Colombia has a possibly time-limited opportunity to prevent an HIV epidemic by implementing harm reduction interventions among young, newly initiated PWID.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Benzodiazepines are a widely prescribed psychoactive drug; in the U.S., both medical and nonmedical use of benzodiazepines has increased markedly in the past 15 years. Long-term use can lead to tolerance and dependence, and abrupt withdrawal can cause seizures or other life-threatening symptoms. Benzodiazepines are often used nonmedically in conjunction with other drugs, and with opioids in particular-a combination that can increase the risk for fatal and non-fatal overdose. This mixed-methods study examines nonmedical use of benzodiazepines among young adults in New York City and its relationship with opioid use. METHODS: For qualitative analysis, 46 90-minute semi-structured interviews were conducted with young adult opioid users (ages 18-32). Interviews were transcribed and coded for key themes. For quantitative analysis, 464 young adult opioid users (ages 18-29) were recruited using Respondent-Driven Sampling and completed structured interviews. Benzodiazepine use was assessed via a self-report questionnaire that included measures related to nonmedical benzodiazepine and opioid use. RESULTS: Participants reported using benzodiazepines nonmedically for a wide variety of reasons, including: to increase the high of other drugs; to lessen withdrawal symptoms; and to come down from other drugs. Benzodiazepines were described as readily available and cheap. There was a high prevalence (93%) of nonmedical benzodiazepine use among nonmedical opioid users, with 57% reporting regular nonmedical use. In bivariate analyses, drug-related risk behaviours such as polysubstance use, drug binging, heroin injection and overdose were strongly associated with regular nonmedical benzodiazepine use. In multivariate analysis, growing up in a middle-income household (earning between $51,000 and $100,000 annually), lifetime overdose experience, having ever used cocaine regularly, having ever been prescribed benzodiazepines, recent drug binging, and encouraging fellow drug users to use benzodiazepines to cope with opioid withdrawal were consistently strong predictors of regular nonmedical benzodiazepine use. CONCLUSION: Nonmedical benzodiazepine use may be common among nonmedical opioid users due to its drug-related multi-functionality. Harm reduction messages should account for the multiple functions benzodiazepines serve in a drug-using context, and encourage drug users to tailor their endorsement of benzodiazepines to peers to include safer alternatives.

AB  - Sexual relations between drug injectors (IDUs) and crack smokers (CS), and non-drug users are a major means of HIV spread to the broader population. However there is little literature describing community processes that regulate sexual and social partnerships among these groups. We describe these relationships in Bushwick, a low-income, mainly Latino neighbourhood in Brooklyn, NY. In this community, IDU and CS are heavily stigmatized, both by non-users and by some users. Known IDU/CS may find it harder to start and maintain social and sexual relationships, and to get jobs or support. Partially as a result of this stigma, IDU/CS attempt to 'keep it together' and hide either their drug use or its extent from other residents. Nevertheless, other residents believe, sometimes falsely, that they can distinguish users from nonusers. We describe some potential negative consequences of these beliefs and interactions, including their effects on risk for HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Research on heroin withdrawal has primarily been done clinically, thus focussing on symptom severity, physiological manifestations, and how withdrawal impairs normal functioning. However, there is little scientific knowledge on how heroin withdrawal affects injection behaviour. This paper explores how withdrawal episodes heighten unsafe injection practices and how some long-term injectors manage such risks. METHODS: We interviewed 32 injection drug users in New York City who had been injecting drugs for 8-15 years (21 HIV and HCV uninfected; 3 HIV and HCV infected; and 8 singly infected with HCV). We used in-depth life history interviews to inquire about IDUs' life history, injection practices and drug use behaviour over time. Analysis used grounded theory techniques. RESULTS: Withdrawal can enhance risk by undermining IDUs' willingness to inject safely; increasing the likelihood of attending risky settings; raising the number of injection partners; and seeking ad hoc partners for drug or needle sharing. Some IDUs have developed practices to cope with withdrawal and avoid risky practices (examples include carrying clean needles to shooting galleries and sniffing rather than injecting). Strategies to avoid withdrawal include back up methods, resorting to credit, collaborating with others, regimenting drug intake, balancing drug intake with money available, and/or resorting to treatment. CONCLUSION: Withdrawal periods can heighten risky injection practices. Some IDUs have applied strategies to avoid withdrawal or used practices to cope without engaging in risky practices. These behaviours might in turn help IDUs prevent an infection with hepatitis C or HIV.

AB  - Significant advances have been made in preventing HIV infection among injectors but we still know little about preventing hepatitis C (HCV). Both prevalence and incidence of hepatitis C can remain high among IDUs even in the context of widespread implementation of harm reduction programmes. We need to develop new ways to fill the knowledge gap regarding HCV prevention. One way is to learn from the experts--those IDUs who, after long-term injection in social milieus of high hepatitis C prevalence, nonetheless remain uninfected. We describe a recently commenced program of research that focuses on understanding the strategies, behaviours, and environmental factors associated with "staying safe". This represents a 180-degree turn in IDU research where the focus has traditionally been on risk. Since social, cultural and environmental factors, as well as the vagaries of human strategic discovery by drug users can vary among localities, researchers in four different contexts--New York City, Valencia, Sydney and London--are collaborating in parallel Staying Safe studies. These studies aim to provide the conceptual basis for developing a new generation of HCV prevention programs to assist both new and experienced IDUs to remain uninfected over the long run.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to identify independent prognostic factors for survival in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer who had persistent disease identified at second-look surgery. METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of all patients with epithelial ovarian cancer who had positive findings at second-look surgery between June 1991 and June 2002. All patients achieved a complete clinical remission after a prescribed course of primary therapy. Survival was determined from the time of second-look surgery until last follow-up or death. RESULTS: The study included a total of 262 patients, with a median age of 54 years (range, 22-80). Of the 262 patients, 166 (63%) had died of disease. Records of initial (salvage) treatment after the positive second-look surgery were available for 243 patients. Therapies included the following: intraperitoneal (IP) cisplatin, 71 (29%); IP cisplatin combined with a second drug, 53 (22%); IP therapy other than cisplatin, 29 (12%); intravenous (IV) chemotherapy, 50 (21%); IP and IV therapy, 35 (14%); and oral chemotherapy, 5 (2%). Of the 13 potential prognostic factors analyzed, only 2 factors emerged that, when combined, were significant--residual disease after primary surgery and size of persistent disease found at second-look surgery. Patients with <or=1 cm residual disease after primary surgery and microscopic disease at second-look surgery had significantly improved survival. CONCLUSION: In our analysis, the only prognostic factor for survival in patients with positive second-look procedures was a combination of residual disease after primary surgery and size of persistent disease identified at second-look surgery. No individual chemotherapy treatment imparted a survival advantage. Novel that therapeutic approaches are needed in this setting.

AB  - Rising rates of HIV infection among younger black men who have sex with men (YBMSM) in the USA have generated a public health emergency. Living with HIV requires deep and persistent social support often available only from close confidants. Enlisting endogenous support network members into the care of HIV-infected YBMSM may help shape sustainable supportive environments, leading to long-term improvements in mental and HIV-specific health outcomes. The present study examined trends in support network change over time after new HIV diagnoses among 14 YBMSM. Participants completed a social network survey that utilized sociograms to record support confidants (SCs) preceding HIV diagnosis and at one and nine months postdiagnosis. Reported SCs included family of origin, friends, sex partners, and other associates. Analysis revealed three distinct patterns of change: high gain, high turnover, and stable networks. These patterns offer valuable insights into the social support of YBMSM during the period following diagnosis. This research underscores a growing movement to embrace key support figures in the lives of YBMSM, who may be critical to promoting overall health and adherence to HIV-care.

AB  - Background: U.S. rural populations have been disproportionately affected by the syndemic of opioid-use disorder (OUD) and the associated increase in overdoses and risk of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission. Local health departments (LHDs) can play a critical role in the response to this syndemic. We utilized two geospatial approaches to identify areas of discordance between LHD service availability and disease burden to inform service prioritization in rural settings. Methods: We surveyed rural Illinois LHDs to assess their OUD-related services, and calculated county-level opioid overdose, HIV, and hepatitis C diagnosis rates. Bivariate choropleth maps were created to display LHD service provision relative to disease burden in rural Illinois counties. Results: Most rural LHDs provided limited OUD-related services, although many LHDs provided HIV and HCV testing. Bivariate mapping showed rural counties with limited OUD treatment and HIV services and with corresponding higher outcome/disease rates to be dispersed throughout Illinois. Additionally, rural counties with limited LHD-offered hepatitis C services and high hepatitis C diagnosis rates were geographically concentrated in southern Illinois. Conclusions: Bivariate mapping can enable geographic targeting of resources to address the opioid crisis and related infectious disease by identifying areas with low LHD services relative to high disease burden.

AB  - Religious congregations can potentially reach disproportionately affected populations with HIV programming, however, factors that influence congregational involvement in HIV are not well-studied. Utilizing comparative case methods and in-depth qualitative data from a diverse sample of 14 urban congregations, we examine a range of attitudinal, organizational, resource, and demographic factors to systematically identify different case scenarios-i.e., combinations of characteristics-associated with the level and types of HIV activities in which the congregational cases tended to be involved. For example, White or mixed race congregations with active gay constituencies and an African-American congregation with a strong lay HIV champion were among the high HIV involvement case scenarios, compared to African-American congregations with a health emphasis but no lay HIV champion among the medium HIV involvement scenarios, and fundamentalist African-American and Latino congregations among the low HIV involvement scenarios. Two key factors that appeared influential across case scenarios included the existence of lay champions for HIV activities and the general theological orientation of the congregation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In the U.S. and Canada, people who inject drugs' (PWID) enrollment in medication-assisted treatment (MAT) has been associated with a reduced likelihood that they will assist others in injection initiation events. We aimed to qualitatively explore PWID's experiences with MAT and other drug treatment and related recovery services in Tijuana Mexico, a resource-limited setting disproportionately impacted by injection drug use. METHODS: PReventing Injecting by Modifying Existing Responses (PRIMER) seeks to assess socio-structural factors associated with PWID provision of injection initiation assistance. This analysis drew on qualitative data from Proyecto El Cuete (ECIV), a Tijuana-based PRIMER-linked cohort study. In-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with a subset of study participants to further explore experiences with MAT and other drug treatment services. Qualitative thematic analyses examined experiences with these services, including MAT enrollment, and related experiences with injection initiation assistance provision. RESULTS: At PRIMER baseline, 607(81.1%) out of 748 participants reported recent daily IDU, 41(5.5%) reported recent injection initiation assistance, 92(12.3%) reported any recent drug treatment or recovery service access, and 21(2.8%) reported recent MAT enrollment (i.e., methadone). Qualitative analysis (n = 21; female = 8) revealed that, overall, abstinence-based recovery services did not meet participants' recovery goals, with substance use-related social connections in these contexts potentially shaping injection initiation assistance. Themes also highlighted individual-level (i.e., ambivalence and MAT-related stigma) and structural-level (i.e., cost and availability) barriers to MAT enrollment. CONCLUSION: Tijuana's abstinence-based drug treatment and recovery services were viewed as unable to meet participants' recovery-related goals, which could be limiting the potential benefits of these services. Drug treatment and recovery services, including MAT, need to be modified to improve accessibility and benefits, like preventing transitions into drug injecting, for PWID.

AB  - Though prevalence of HIV and especially Hepatitis C is high among people who inject drugs (PWID) in New York, about a third of those who have injected for 8-15 years have avoided infection by either virus despite their long-term drug use. Based on life history interviews with 35 long-term PWID in New York, this article seeks to show how successful integration and performance of various drug using and non-drug using roles may have contributed to some of these PWID's staying uninfected with either virus. We argue that analysis of non-risk related aspects of the lives of the risk-takers (PWID) is very important in understanding their risk-taking behaviour and its outcomes (infection statuses). Drawing on work-related, social and institutional resources, our double-negative informants underwent both periods of stability and turmoil without getting infected.

AB  - Russia has a widespread injection drug use epidemic with high prevalence of HIV and HCV among people who inject drugs (PWID). We conducted a mixed methods study of young (age 18-26) hard drug users in St. Petersburg. Thirty-nine structured and 10 semi-structured interviews were conducted. No HIV cases and two HCV cases were detected among the PWID subsample (n = 29). Amphetamine and other stimulants were common (70%), opioid use was rare and episodic. Consistent condom use was 10%. No PWID reported syringe-sharing, 51% reported other drug paraphernalia sharing. Most (89%) never or rarely communicated with older (30 +) opiate users. A new cohort of drug users in St. Petersburg may have emerged, which is much safer in its injection practices compared to previous cohorts. However, risky sexual practices among this new cohort may expose them to the possibility of sexual transmission of HIV and widespread drug paraphernalia sharing to the HCV epidemic.

AB  - The causes of death among injecting drug users. (IDUs) are still being discussed worldwide. We analysed the causes of death among IDUs attending 26 centres for drug users in North-Eastern Italy from 1985 to 1994. The study of a total number of 1,022 deaths reveals the following: (1) AIDS has become the primary cause of death among IDUs since 1991 and is rising even in an area with a moderate HIV seroprevalence; (2) the mean age of death in AIDS patients proved higher than among patients who died of other causes (which may be due to the long incubation period of AIDS); (3) our data do not reveal higher HIV seroprevalence among IDUs who died of overdose and suicide as opposed to IDUs who died of other causes; (4) the mortality rate in IDUs is significantly higher when compared to that of the general population in the same age group.

AB  - We propose that one manifestation of altered sphingolipid metabolism within tumor cells may be a reduced sensitivity to anti-cancer therapies because of an inability to produce a sufficient apoptotic signal via sphingomyelin hydrolysis to ceramide. If so, then sphingomyelin administration could reverse this effect and increase a tumor's sensitivity to chemotherapy. In vivo, intravenous sphingomyelin (10 mg/day, 7 days) potentiated 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy (0.45 mg/day, 5 days) when co-administered to HT29 human colonic xenograft-bearing nude mice. In vitro, sphingomyelin (SM) at its maximum tolerated concentration increased 5-fluorouracil and doxorubicin sensitivity of HCT15 and MOSER (1 mg/ml SM) and LS174T and SW480 human colonic tumor cells (0.1 mg/ml) approximately 100-300%. At 1 mg/ml SM, however, no effect was seen using HT29, LoVo and WiDr cells. There was no sensitization of normal human umbilical cord endothelial cells. Thus, sphingomyelin co-administration may be one method to improve the selective efficacy of chemotherapy in some tumors, possibly through enhancement of the apoptotic response.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Cirrhosis and chronic inflammation precede development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in approximately 80% of cases. We investigated immune-related gene expression patterns in liver tissues surrounding early-stage HCCs and chemopreventive agents that might alter these patterns to prevent liver tumorigenesis. METHODS: We analyzed gene expression profiles of nontumor liver tissues from 392 patients with early-stage HCC (training set, N = 167 and validation set, N = 225) and liver tissue from patients with cirrhosis without HCC (N = 216, controls) to identify changes in expression of genes that regulate the immune response that could contribute to hepatocarcinogenesis. We defined 172 genes as markers for this deregulated immune response, which we called the immune-mediated cancer field (ICF). We analyzed the expression data of liver tissues from 216 patients with cirrhosis without HCC and investigated the association between this gene expression signature and development of HCC and outcomes of patients (median follow-up, 10 years). Human liver tissues were also analyzed by histology. C57BL/6J mice were given a single injection of diethylnitrosamine (DEN) followed by weekly doses of carbon tetrachloride to induce liver fibrosis and tumorigenesis. Mice were then orally given the multiple tyrosine inhibitor nintedanib or vehicle (controls); liver tissues were collected and histology, transcriptome, and protein analyses were performed. We also analyzed transcriptomes of liver tissues collected from mice on a choline-deficient high-fat diet, which developed chronic liver inflammation and tumors, orally given aspirin and clopidogrel or the anti-inflammatory agent sulindac vs mice on a chow (control) diet. RESULTS: We found the ICF gene expression pattern in 50% of liver tissues from patients with cirrhosis without HCC and in 60% of nontumor liver tissues from patients with early-stage HCC. The liver tissues with the ICF gene expression pattern had 3 different features: increased numbers of effector T cells; increased expression of genes that suppress the immune response and activation of transforming growth factor β signaling; or expression of genes that promote inflammation and activation of interferon gamma signaling. Patients with cirrhosis and liver tissues with the immunosuppressive profile (10% of cases) had a higher risk of HCC (hazard ratio, 2.41; 95% confidence interval, 1.21-4.80). Mice with chemically induced fibrosis or diet-induced steatohepatitis given nintedanib or aspirin and clopidogrel down-regulated the ICF gene expression pattern in liver and developed fewer and smaller tumors than mice given vehicle. CONCLUSIONS: We identified an immune-related gene expression pattern in liver tissues of patients with early-stage HCC, called the ICF, that is associated with risk of HCC development in patients with cirrhosis. Administration of nintedanib or aspirin and clopidogrel to mice with chronic liver inflammation caused loss of this gene expression pattern and development of fewer and smaller liver tumors. Agents that alter immune regulatory gene expression patterns associated with carcinogenesis might be tested as chemopreventive agents in patients with cirrhosis.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: We aimed to investigate the characteristics of pregnant women who required either mood stabilizer or antipsychotic treatment. These women requiring such treatment are likely to be more mentally unwell and thus carry a higher burden of comorbidities associated with poor pregnancy outcomes. METHODS: This retrospective review investigated the common characteristics of pregnant women who were prescribed with antipsychotics or mood stabilizers under a major city's public maternal mental health service. Demographic data, pregnancy factors and prenatal care, stressors and support, concurrent medical and substance abuse problems, and ongoing maternal mental health issues were recorded. RESULTS: Most pregnancies were unplanned. Commonly, social stressors, medical problems, and substance use were identified. The most common diagnosis was bipolar disorder. DISCUSSION: Pregnant women requiring treatment with mood stabilizers or antipsychotics are a complex clinical population, with multiple risk factors for negative pregnancy outcome, before even considering the potential risk from psychotropic agents and mental illness itself. Obtaining reliable data about substance use and medication compliance remains problematic.

AB  - We investigated how different models of HIV transmission, and assumptions regarding the distribution of unprotected sex and syringe-sharing events ('risk acts'), affect quantitative understanding of HIV transmission process in people who inject drugs (PWID). The individual-based model simulated HIV transmission in a dynamic sexual and injecting network representing New York City. We constructed four HIV transmission models: model 1, constant probabilities; model 2, random number of sexual and parenteral acts; model 3, viral load individual assigned; and model 4, two groups of partnerships (low and high risk). Overall, models with less heterogeneity were more sensitive to changes in numbers risk acts, producing HIV incidence up to four times higher than that empirically observed. Although all models overestimated HIV incidence, micro-simulations with greater heterogeneity in the HIV transmission modelling process produced more robust results and better reproduced empirical epidemic dynamics.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We used an individual-based model to evaluate the effects of hypothetical prevention interventions on HIV incidence trajectories in a concentrated, mixed epidemic setting from 2011 to 2021, and using Cabo Verde as an example. METHODS: Simulations were conducted to evaluate the extent to which early HIV treatment and optimization of care, HIV testing, condom distribution, and substance abuse treatment could eliminate new infections (i.e., reduce incidence to less than 10 cases per 10,000 person-years) among non-drug users, female sex workers (FSW), and people who use drugs (PWUD). RESULTS: Scaling up all four interventions resulted in the largest decreases in HIV, with estimates ranging from 1.4 (95 % CI 1.36-1.44) per 10,000 person-years among non-drug users to 8.2 (95 % CI 7.8-8.6) per 10,000 person-years among PWUD in 2021. Intervention scenarios prioritizing FWS and PWUD also resulted in HIV incidence estimates at or below 10 per 10,000 person-years by 2021 for all population sub-groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that scaling up multiple interventions among entire population is necessary to achieve elimination. However, prioritizing key populations with this combination prevention strategy may also result in a substantial decrease in total incidence.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Young Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM) are at highest risk for HIV seroconversion in the United States. Successful movement through the HIV care continuum is an important intervention for limiting onwards HIV transmission. OBJECTIVE: Little data exists on how substances most commonly used by YBMSM, such as marijuana, are related to the HIV continuum, which represents the primary aim of this study. METHODS: A cohort of YBMSM (n = 618) was generated through respondent-driven sampling. Frequency of marijuana use and marijuana use as a sex-drug were assessed across the HIV care continuum using weighted logistic regression models. RESULTS: Study participants reported more intermittent marijuana use (n = 254, 56.2%) compared to heavy use (n = 198, 43.8%). Our sample contained 212 (34.3%) HIV seropositive participants of which 52 (24.5%) were unaware of their HIV positive status. Study participants who were heavy marijuana users were more likely to be unaware of their HIV seropositive status (AOR: 4.18; 95% CI 1.26, 13.89). All other stages in the care continuum demonstrated no significant differences between those who use marijuana intermittently or heavily or as a sex-drug and nonusers. CONCLUSIONS: YBMSM who used marijuana heavily were more likely to be HIV-positive unaware than those who never used marijuana. Findings were inconclusive regarding the relationships between marijuana use and other HIV care continuum metrics. However, knowledge of ones' HIV status is a critical requirement for engaging in care and may have implications for onwards HIV transmission.

AB  - Debate remains as to the relative HIV transmission contributions from individuals who are recently HIV-infected and individuals who have long-term infections. In this study, we examine the relationship between new HIV seroconversions occurring among young black men who have sex with men and network proximity to recently or long-term HIV-infected individuals. A cohort of young black men who have sex with men (N = 618) was generated through respondent-driven sampling across 3 waves. A recent HIV infection was defined as either: (1) a confirmed seroconversion ≤9 months before interview date or (2) a laboratory confirmed acute infection; long-term HIV-infected individuals were defined as a diagnosis date ≥9 months before interview date. Respondent-driven sampling-weighted logistic regression was used to examine network proximity of HIV transmission events to HIV-infected individuals in the network. Within the cohort, 343 (55.5%) participants were identified as HIV seronegative at baseline. Of these, 33 (9.6%) seroconverted during the study period. The odds of seroconversion increased significantly with each additional recent HIV-infected individual in one's network [adjusted odds ratio = 12.96; 95% confidence interval: 5.69 to 29.50], but were not significantly altered by the number of long-term infected individuals in one's network. In addition, for each member of one's network who used pre-exposure prophylaxis, the odds of seroconversion decreased significantly (adjusted odds ratio = 0.44; 95% confidence interval: 0.20 to 0.96). Early diagnosis and treatment is a critical first step in the HIV care continuum and together with pre-exposure prophylaxis awareness and use are critical targets for disrupting the transmission of HIV through most at-risk networks.

AB  - Men who have sex with men (MSM) in the USA continue to have high rates of HIV infection. Increasingly, in addition to behavioral factors, biomedical interventions have been found to play important roles in HIV prevention. In this analysis, we used four waves of cross-sectional data (2004, 2008, 2011, and 2014) from the National HIV Behavioral Surveillance System (NHBS) to examine trends in key behaviors and biomedical interventions among MSM in Chicago (N = 3298). Logistic regression was used to determine changes in behaviors and use of biomedical interventions. Condomless sex increased significantly in waves 3 and 4, compared to wave 1: wave 3 (AOR = 2.07; 95% CI 1.53, 2.78) and wave 4 (AOR = 2.19; 95% CI 1.62, 2.96). Compared to those aged 18-24, older participants were significantly less likely to be routinely tested for HIV: 30-39 (AOR = 0.63; 95% CI 0.48, 0.83), 40-49 (AOR = 0.40; 95% CI 0.29, 0.55), and >50 (AOR = 0.28; 95% CI 0.18, 0.43). Awareness of both post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)(​AOR = 3.13; 95% CI 1.22, 8.03) and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)(​AOR = 10.02; 95% CI 2.95, 34.01) increased significantly in wave 4, compared to wave 3. These results suggest a potential increase in HIV rates among men with main and casual partners and should be monitored closely as PrEP becomes more widespread among MSM of all races and ethnicities in Chicago. This study also suggests that further analyses of the barriers to PEP and PreP uptake among high-risk populations are necessary.

AB  - Black men who have sex with men (BMSM) are highest risk for HIV seroconversion in the United States. Little attention has been paid to marijuana use among BMSM and potential for HIV risk. A sample of 202 BMSM was generated through respondent driven sampling. The relationship between differential marijuana use and both HIV risk behavior and social network factors were examined using weighted logistic regression. Of the BMSM in this sample 60.4 % use marijuana in general and 20.8 % use marijuana as sex-drug. General marijuana use was significantly associated with participation in group sex (AOR 3.50; 95 % CI 1.10-11.10) while marijuana use as a sex drug was significantly associated with both participation in condomless sex (AOR 2.86; 95% CI 1.07-7.67) and group sex (AOR 3.39; 95% CI 1.03-11.22). Respondents with a moderate or high perception of network members who use marijuana were more likely to use marijuana both in general and as a sex-drug. Network member marijuana use, while not associated with risk behaviors, is associated with individual marijuana use and individual marijuana use in the context of sex is associated with risk practices. Targeting interventions towards individuals and their respective networks that use marijuana as a sex drug may reduce HIV risk.

AB  - Individuals with recent/acute HIV-infection have an increased likelihood of disease transmission. To evaluate effectiveness of identifying recent infections, we compared networks of recently and long-term HIV-infected individuals. The Transmission Reduction Intervention Project included two separate arms of recruitment, networks of recently HIV-infected individuals and networks of long-term HIV-infected individuals. Networks of each were recruited and tested for HIV and syphilis infection. The per-seed yield ratios of recruitment were compared between arms. Overall, 84 (41.6%) of 202 participants were identified as HIV-positive. HIV prevalence was higher (p < 0.001) among networks of recent seeds (33/96, 34.4%) compared to long-term seeds (6/31, 19.4%). More individuals were identified with active syphilis infection (p = 0.007) among networks of recent seeds (15/96, 15.6%), compared to networks of long-term seeds (3/31, 9.7%). Network-based recruitment of recently HIV-infected individuals was more effective at identifying HIV and syphilis infection. Allocation of public health resources may be improved by targeting interventions toward networks of recently HIV-infected individuals.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine how network-level factors influence individual risk of HIV acquisition, which is key in preventing disease transmission. METHODS: We recruited a cohort of young Black men who have sex with men (n = 618) in Chicago, Illinois, from 2013 to 2016. We identified potential molecular ties via pairwise genetic distance analysis of HIV pol sequences with links inferred between individuals whose sequences were 1.5% or less genetically distant. We defined clusters as 1 or more connections to another individual. We conducted entity resolution between confidant, sexual, referral, and Facebook network data between network types. RESULTS: Of 266 (43.0%) participants identified as HIV-positive, we obtained 86 (32.3%) genetic sequences. Of these, 35 (40.7%) were linked to 1 or more other sequence; however, none of these were identified in first-, second-, or third-degree confidant and sexual networks. Minimal overlap existed between genetic and Facebook ties. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that HIV transmissions may have occurred before elicitation of network data; future studies should expand the data collection timeframe to more accurately determine risk networks. Virtual network data, such as Facebook, may be particularly useful in developing one's risk environment.

AB  - Purposeof Review To describe 4 primary areas of trauma experienced by black transgender women, resilience demonstrated by the community, and opportunities for trauma surgeons to better serve this community. Recent Findings Transphobia, racism, and misogyny place black transgender women at high risk for mistreatment in the workplace, criminal legal system, and community spaces. These experiences of social exclusion and trauma facilitate social isolation and reduced engagement with necessary services, like healthcare. Furthermore, many black transgender women do not seek care due to experiences of racial and gender microaggressions. As such, it is necessary that medical professionals who engage this community provide culturally responsive care. Black transgender women seeking care will likely present after having experienced significant social rejection as well as mental and physical traumas. Accordingly, medical professionals who engage them must be considerate of the impacts of their unique experiences when providing them care.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Compare the safety and efficacy of topical gentian violet with that of nystatin oral suspension (NYS) for the treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis in HIV-1-infected adults in resource-limited settings. DESIGN: Multicenter, open-label, evaluator-blinded, randomized clinical trial at eight international sites, within the AIDS Clinical Trials Group. STUDY PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTION: Adult HIV-infected participants with oropharyngeal candidiasis, stratified by CD4 cell counts and antiretroviral therapy status at study entry, were randomized to receive either gentian violet (0.00165%, BID) or NYS (500 000 units, QID) for 14 days. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Cure or improvement after 14 days of treatment. Signs and symptoms of oropharyngeal candidiasis were evaluated in an evaluator-blinded manner. RESULTS: The study was closed early per Data Safety Monitoring Board after enrolling 221 participants (target = 494). Among the 182 participants eligible for efficacy analysis, 63 (68.5%) in the gentian violet arm had cure or improvement of oropharyngeal candidiasis versus 61 (67.8%) in the NYS arm, resulting in a nonsizable difference of 0.007 (95% confidence interval: -0.129, 0.143). There was no sizable difference in cure rates between the two arms (-0.0007; 95% confidence interval: -0.146, 0.131). No gentian violet-related adverse events were noted. No sizable differences were identified in tolerance, adherence, quality of life, or acceptability of study drugs. In gentian violet arm, 61 and 39% of participants reported 'no' and 'mild-to-moderate' staining, respectively. Cost for medication procurement was significantly lower for gentian violet versus NYS (median $2.51 and 19.42, respectively, P = 0.01). CONCLUSION: Efficacy of gentian violet was not statistically different than NYS, was well tolerated, and its procurement cost was substantially less than NYS.

AB  - We examined the mechanism of constriction and muscarinic augmentation of contraction of airway smooth muscle caused by platelet-activating factor (PAF) in airways from 55 Sprague-Dawley rats perfused through the isolated bronchial circulation (BC) and pulmonary circulation (PC) and isometrically in tissue perfusion chambers. Dose-response curves were generated cumulatively by infusing 10(-10) to 10(-7) mol PAF dissolved in Krebs-Henseleit solution buffer containing 4% bovine serum albumin into the BC or PC. The efficacy of PAF in central airways (BC) was approximately twofold greater in increasing lung resistance (RL) than for more peripheral airways perfused by the PC (P less than 0.05). Tachyphylaxis was demonstrated in both BC and PC for preparations in which a second PAF dose-response curve was generated. Bolus injection of 10(-6) mol of the PAF antagonist, CV-6209, plus 10(-7) mol PAF caused 81% reversal of the maximal BC response. The same dose of CV-6209 reversed the response to PAF in the PC by 99.2%. Initial administration of 10(-6) mol CV-6209 with PAF prevented completely contraction elicited by PAF in the BC and PC. Concentration-response studies also were generated isometrically in tissue perfusion chambers from 64 tracheal smooth muscle strips. Maximal contraction elicited by 10(-6) M PAF was blocked completely with 10(-6) M CV-6209. In separate studies, addition of 10(-6) mol CV-6209 to the BC perfusate caused 93% blockade of the RL response to PAF and 100% inhibition when administered in the PC. Prior administration of PAF caused two- to fourfold augmentation of the contractile response to acetylcholine (ACh) within the same preparation; in the presence of CV-6209, the response to ACh was unchanged.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - We have monitored fusion between cell pairs consisting of a single human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) envelope glycoprotein-expressing cell and a CD4+ target cell, which had been labeled with both a fluorescent lipid in the membrane and a fluorescent solute in the cytosol. We developed a new three-color assay to keep track of the cell into which fluorescent lipids and/or solutes are redistributed. Lipid and solute redistribution occur as a result of opening a lipid-permissive fusion pore and a solute-permissive fusion pore (FPS), respectively. A synthetic peptide (DP178) corresponding to residues 643-678 of the HIV-1LAI gp120-gp41 sequence (Wild, C.T., D.C. Shugars, T.K. Greenwell, C.B. McDanal, and T.J. Matthews. 1994. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 91:12676-12680) completely inhibited FPS at 50 ng/ml, whereas at that concentration there was 20-30% fusion activity measured by the lipid redistribution. The differences detected in lipid mixing versus contents mixing are maintained up to 6 h of coculture of gp120-41-expressing cells with target cells, indicating that DP178 can "clamp" the fusion complex in the lipid mixing intermediate for very long time periods. A peptide from the NH2-terminal of gp41, DP107, inhibited HIV-1LAI gp120-gp41-mediated cell fusion at higher concentrations, but with no differences between lipid and aqueous dye redistribution at the different inhibitor concentrations. The inhibition of solute redistribution by DP178 was complete when the peptide was added to the fusion reaction mixture during the first 15 min of coculture. We have analyzed the inhibition data in terms of a fusion pore dilation model that incorporates the recently determined high resolution structure of the gp41 core.

AB  - We have examined mutations in the ectodomain of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 transmembrane glycoprotein gp41 within a region immediately adjacent to the membrane-spanning domain for their effect on the outcome of the fusion cascade. Using the recently developed three-color assay (I. Muñoz-Barroso, S. Durell, K. Sakaguchi, E. Appella, and R. Blumenthal, J. Cell Biol. 140:315-323, 1998), we have assessed the ability of the mutant gp41s to transfer lipid and small solutes from susceptible target cells to the gp120-gp41-expressing cells. The results were compared with the syncytium-inducing capabilities of these gp41 mutants. Two mutant proteins were incapable of mediating both dye transfer and syncytium formation. Two mutant proteins mediated dye transfer but were less effective at inducing syncytium formation than was wild-type gp41. The most interesting mutant proteins were those that were not capable of inducing syncytium formation but still mediated dye transfer, indicating that the fusion cascade was blocked beyond the stage of small fusion pore formation. Fusion mediated by the mutant gp41s was inhibited by the peptides DP178 and C34.

AB  - We have previously described the photoactivated depot (PAD) approach for the light-stimulated release of therapeutic proteins such as insulin. The aim of this method is to release insulin from a shallow dermal depot in response to blood glucose information, using transcutaneous irradiation. Our first approach utilized a photocleavable group that linked insulin to an insoluble but injectable polymer bead. The bead conferred insolubility, ensuring that the injected material stayed at the site of injection, until light cleaved the link, and allowed insulin to be absorbed systemically. While this proved to be effective, the use of a polymer to ensure insolubility introduces two major design problems: (1) low concentration of insulin, as a majority of the material is composed of polymer, and (2) upon release of the insulin, the polymer has to be cleared from the system. To address these two problems, in this work, we have pursued "hydrophobic tags", photocleavable small nonpolar molecules that confer insolubility to the modified insulin prior to irradiation without the bulk or need for biodegradation required of polymers. We developed a combined solid- and solution-phase synthetic approach that allowed us to incorporate a range of small nonpolar moieties, including peptides, into the final depot materials. The resulting materials are >90% w/w insulin and have sharply decreased solubilities relative to unmodified insulin (≤1000 × lower). We demonstrated that they can be milled into low micron-sized particles that can be readily injected through a 31G needle. These suspensions can be prepared at an effective concentration of 20 mM insulin, a concentration at which 120 μL contains 7 days of insulin for a typical adult. Finally, upon photolysis, the insoluble particles release soluble, native insulin in a predictable fashion. These combined properties make these new modified insulins nearly ideal as candidates for PAD materials.

AB  - Focusing on the social environment as well as the individual should both enhance our understanding of HIV transmission and assist in the development of more effective prevention programs. Networks are an important aspect of drug injectors' social environment. We distinguish between (1) risk networks (the people among whom HIV risk behaviors occur) as vectors of disease transmission, and (2) social networks (the people among whom there are social interactions with a mutual orientation to one another) as generators and disseminators of social influence. These concepts are applied to analyses of data from interviews with drug injectors in two studies. In the first study drug injectors' risk networks converge with their social networks: 70% inject or share syringes with a spouse or sex partner, a running partner, or with friends or others whom they know. Qualitative data from interviews with injectors in the second study also show that the social relationships between drug injectors and members of their risk network are often based on long-standing and multiplex relationships, such as those based on kinship, friendship, marital and sexual ties, and economic activity. In the first study the vast majority of injectors, over 90%, have social ties with non-injectors. Injectors with more frequent social contacts with non-injectors engage in lower levels of injecting risk behavior. Risk settings may function as risk networks: injectors in this study who inject at shooting galleries are more likely than those who do not to rent used syringes, borrow used syringes and inject with strangers. Since the adoption of a network approach is relatively new, a number of issues require further attention. These include: how to utilize social networks among drug injectors to reduce risk through peer pressure; how to promote risk reduction by encouraging ties between injectors and non-injectors; and how to integrate biographical and historical change into understanding network processes. Appropriate methodologies to study drug injectors' networks should be developed, including techniques to reach hidden populations, computer software for managing and analyzing network data bases, and statistical methods for drawing inferences from data gathered through dependent sampling designs.

AB  - In a cross-sectional study of 174 new injecting drug users (IDUs) in New York City who had injected for < or = 6 years, we examined whether those who both share syringes and have personal risk networks that include high-risk injectors are particularly likely to be infected with HIV. Subjects were street recruited between July 1991 and January 1993, were interviewed about their risk behaviors in the prior 2 years and their personal risk networks with other IDUs in the prior 30 days, and were tested for HIV; 20% were HIV seropositive. Among those who both shared syringes and had a personal risk network member who injected more than once a day, 40% were HIV seropositive (versus 14% for others, p < 0.001). In simultaneous multiple logistic regression, the interaction of both sharing syringes and having a personal risk network member who injected more than once a day remained independently and significantly associated with being HIV seropositive (OR, 3.57; 95% CI, 1.22, 10.43; p < 0.020), along with Latino race/ethnicity and exchanging sex for money or drugs. These findings suggest that the combination of sharing syringes with having a high-risk personal network is a risk factor for HIV infection among new IDUs. Studies of risk factors for HIV infection among new IDUs and interventions to reduce the spread of HIV among them should focus on their risk networks as well as their risk behaviors.

AB  - The objective of this study was to demonstrate how injecting drug users' (IDC's) HIV risk networks affect their risk for infection with HIV and influence their HIV risk behaviors. Concepts utilized in a network approach M;ere specified. These concepts included: (I)the distinction between risk networks (thr people with or among whom IDUs-or others at risk of infection with HIV-engage in HIV risk behaviors) and social influence networks (the people who shape each others behavior), (2) the extent to which risk networks and social influence networks overlap. and (3) three levels of network analysis, i.e. the dyad, personal networks, and sociometric networks. The role of IDUs' risk networks in the transmission of HIV and their influence on promoting and preventing HIV risk behaviors were illustrated by reviewing studies of IDUs in New York City as well as other locations. Conclusions indicate that the network approach is a developing area in research on the relationship between injecting drug use and HIV risk. This approach provides a basis for deepening our understanding of this relationship, and could increase our ability to prevent the further spread of HIV among IDUs as well as their sex partners.

AB  - We examine injecting and sexual risk correlates of hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C (HCV) seroprevalence among new injecting drug users (IDUs) (age 18-30 years, injecting < or =6 years). Participants were interviewed/serotested (HIVab, HBVcAb, HCVab) in New York City, February 1999-February 2003. Gender-stratified, multivariate logistic regression was conducted. Participants (N=259) were: 68% male; 81% white. Women were more likely to test HCV seropositive (42% versus 27%) and men HBV seropositive (24% versus 12%); HIV seroprevalence was low (3%). Among both men and women, HBV seropositivity was associated with ever selling sex, and HCV seropositivity with ever having had infected (HIV, HBV or HCV) sex partners (among those ever sharing injecting equipment). Among women only, HBV seropositivity was associated with ever having had infected sex partners (regardless of ever sharing injecting equipment), and HCV seropositivity with > or =300 lifetime drug injections. Among men only, HCV seropositivity was associated with > or =40 lifetime number of sex partners (among those never sharing injecting equipment). In this new IDU sample, HBV and HCV seroprevalence differed by gender and were considerably higher than HIV seroprevalence. Early interventions, targeting injecting and sexual risks and including HBV vaccination, are needed among new IDUs to prevent HBV, HCV and, potentially, HIV epidemics.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence/predictors of transitions to injecting among noninjecting heroin users (NIUs). METHODS: Street-recruited NIUs in New York City, March/1996-March/2003, were interviewed for a prospective cohort study about social network influence (communication promoting injecting; exposure to injectors) and individual susceptibility. A transition to injecting was the first drug injection following baseline. Hazards ratios (HRs) (P < 0.05) were estimated by Cox proportional hazards regression, stratified by baseline injecting history. RESULTS: Of 369 (64% of 579) followed, former-injectors were more likely to transition to injecting (33% or 53/160 vs. 12% or 25/209; 16.0/100 person-years-at-risk [pyar] vs. 4.6/100 pyar; HR = 3.25). Independent predictors among never-injectors included using > or =2 bags of heroin daily (HR = 7.0); social network influence (communication) and homelessness (HR = 6.3); shorter-term heroin use (HR = 5.3); social network influence (exposure) and physically abused (HR = 4.7); friends approve/condone drug injecting (HR = 3.5); lower perceived social distance from injectors (HR = 2.9); and younger age at first heroin use (HR = 1.2). Independent predictors among former-injectors were social network influence (communication) and lower perceived social distance from injectors (HR = 3.4); white race/ethnicity (HR = 2.0); not very afraid of needles (HR = 1.8); and younger age (HR = 1.1). CONCLUSIONS: The risk of initiating injecting was lower than the risk of resuming injecting. Social network influence facilitates transitioning to injecting among those susceptible. Interventions to prevent injecting should address both social network influence and individual susceptibility.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Many heroin users do not inject drugs but may still be at risk of infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV), via sexual or other noninjection-related activity. METHODS: Noninjecting heroin users (NIUs) in New York City who were recruited and prospectively followed during March 1996-February 2003 were tested for anti-HIV, anti-hepatitis B core antigen, and anti-HCV and were interviewed about their sexual and other noninjecting risk. A seroconversion is represented by the first positive test result after the last negative test result. Hazard ratios (HRs) (P<.05) were estimated by use of Cox proportional hazards regression. RESULTS: Of 253 HIV-negative participants, 2 seroconverted (0.29/100 person-years at risk [pyar]); of 184 HBV-negative participants, 16 (3.3/100 pyar); and, of 219 HCV-negative participants, 16 (2.7/100 pyar). Independent predictors of seroconversion were, for HBV, being a female who engages in unprotected receptive anal sex (HR, 6.8), having short-term sex partners (HR, 6.2), and being a male with male sex partners (HR, 5.7); for HCV, being a male who receives money/drugs for sex (HR, 5.6) and sharing noninjecting crack-use equipment (HR, 4.5). CONCLUSIONS: NIUs are at considerable risk of HBV infection via high-risk sex; and, for HCV, via high-risk sexual activity and the sharing of noninjecting crack-use equipment. Interventions in NIUs must seek to reduce high-risk sexual activity and the sharing of noninjecting drug-use equipment.

AB  - To assess whether human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected and/or hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected noninjecting heroin users (NIUs) are a potential sexual transmission bridge to "lower risk" partners, 180 HIV- or HCV-infected NIUs recruited in New York City were interviewed about their sexual behaviors and partnerships. Sixty-two percent were former injecting drug users (IDUs). Partners reported not to be HIV infected, IDUs, or men who have sex with men were defined as lower risk. Among 54 HIV-infected NIUs, lower risk partners were reported by 54% of never IDUs and 23% of former IDUs (P=.02). Among 155 HCV-infected NIUs, lower risk partners were reported by 54% of never IDUs and 45% of former IDUs (not significant). Engaging in unprotected vaginal or anal sex and having lower risk partners was reported by 29% of HIV-infected never IDUs, 12% of HIV-infected former IDUs, 29% of HCV-infected never IDUs, and 34% of HCV-infected former IDUs. HIV-infected NIUs, particularly never IDUs, and, possibly, HCV-infected NIUs, are a potential sexual transmission bridge.

AB  - AIMS: To compare potential risk factors for the transition to injecting among non-injecting heroin users (NIUs) with different injecting histories. DESIGN: Cross-sectional data from baseline structured interviews with NIUs in a study on transitions to injecting. Sample recruited by outreach or chain-referral in New York City (NYC), 1996-1998. SETTING: Recruitment of sample and interviews conducted in a NYC neighborhood where many drug users reside and/or use drugs. PARTICIPANTS: Of 575 NIUs, 67% had never injected; 16% had injected one to nine times (infrequent former injectors (IFI)); and 18% 10 or more times (frequent former injectors (FFI)). MEASUREMENTS: Controlling for age and race/ethnicity, adjusted odds ratios were estimated in multivariate logistic regression, and differences in means tested by ANCOVA. FINDINGS: FFI (compared to never injectors and IFI) were more likely: to be homeless; to be unemployed; to be long-time users; to be younger at first heroin use; to not have initiated heroin use through non-injected routes; to not be afraid of injecting themselves with needles; to sniff heroin with former IDUs; and, for both men and women separately, to have sex partners who were former IDUs. Both FFI and IFI were twice as likely as never injectors to perceive that their friends thought that it was "OK" to inject drugs. CONCLUSIONS: FFI have multiple individual and network characteristics that may increase their risk of injecting drugs. Interventions among NIUs to prevent transitions to injecting need to ascertain NIUs' injecting history and address the many potential risks that FFI have for resuming injecting drug use.

AB  - Noninjecting heroin users (NIUs) were recruited in New York City during 1996-2003. Cumulative logistic regression was used to analyze the correlates of HIV sexual risk from injecting drug users (IDUs) among HIV seronegative NIUs engaging in heterosexual vaginal or anal sex in the past 30 days (N = 347). Participants were 67% male and 70% African American or Latino, with a mean age of 32.6 years. Hierarchical categories of IDU partner sexual risk included (1) no unprotected sex and no IDU sex partners (21%), (2) unprotected sex but not with IDUs (55%), (3) IDU sex partners but no unprotected sex with them (6%), and (4) unprotected sex with IDUs (17%). Independent correlates (p < .05) of HIV sexual risk from IDU partners included female versus male gender (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.01), ex-IDU versus never IDU (AOR = 1.90), and lower versus higher perceived social distance from IDUs (AOR = 1.60). Interventions should target female NIUs, ex-IDUs, and NIU members of IDU social and sexual networks. The study's limitations are noted.

AB  - Considerable voluntary risk reduction has occurred among IVDUs in New York City. The purpose of the AIDS Outreach Project was to improve upon the existing level of risk reduction by providing information and anonymous HIV testing to street-recruited IVDUs. Intake and follow-up interviews were conducted with 121 subjects (44% of 276 at intake), with a mean of 4.5 months between interviews. Significant risk reduction occurred in many drug and sexual risk behaviors, although not in bleach use, and more than half of the subjects continued to engage in high-risk sexual behavior. An analysis of differences in risk reduction between early and later intake groups indicated that external trends were not sufficient to account for observed risk reduction. Among subjects engaged in high-risk behavior at intake, those who injected less or were enrolled in drug abuse treatment were more likely to stop high-risk drug injecting. Subjects who (at intake) engaged in less frequent unprotected sex, or who had had sex with someone with AIDS, were more likely to stop high-risk sexual behavior. The majority of subjects at low risk at intake maintained low-risk behavior. Informational interventions appear to be most successful among those IVDUs already engaging in lower levels of risk behavior. More effective methods are needed for those whose level of risk behavior is greater. These might include peer pressure and distributing bleach (as opposed to only providing information about bleach).

AB  - Comparing drug-injecting risk between cities that differ in the legality of sterile syringe distribution for injection drug use provides a natural experiment to assess the efficacy of legalizing sterile syringe distribution as a structural intervention to prevent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other parenterally transmitted infections among injection drug users (IDUs). This study compares the parenteral risk for HIV and hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) infection among IDUs in Newark, NJ, USA, where syringe distribution programs were illegal during the period when data were collected, and New York City (NYC) where they were legal. IDUs were nontreatment recruited, 2004-2006, serotested, and interviewed about syringe sources and injecting risk behaviors (prior 30 days). In multivariate logistic regression, adjusted odds ratios (AOR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for city differences are estimated controlling for potential city confounders. IDUs in Newark (n = 214) vs. NYC (n = 312) were more likely to test seropositive for HIV (26% vs. 5%; AOR = 3.2; 95% CI = 1.6, 6.1), antibody to the HBV core antigen (70% vs. 27%; AOR = 4.4; 95% CI = 2.8, 6.9), and antibody to HCV (82% vs. 53%; AOR = 3.0; 95% CI = 1.8, 4.9), were less likely to obtain syringes from syringe exchange programs or pharmacies (AOR = 0.004; 95% CI = 0.001, 0.01), and were more likely to obtain syringes from street sellers (AOR = 74.0; 95% CI = 29.9, 183.2), to inject with another IDU's used syringe (AOR = 2.3; 95% CI = 1.1, 5.0), to reuse syringes (AOR = 2.99; 95% CI = 1.63, 5.50), and to not always inject once only with a new, sterile syringe that had been sealed in a wrapper (AOR = 5.4; 95% CI = 2.9, 10.3). In localities where sterile syringe distribution is illegal, IDUs are more likely to obtain syringes from unsafe sources and to engage in injecting risk behaviors. Legalizing and rapidly implementing sterile syringe distribution programs are critical for reducing parenterally transmitted HIV, HBV, and HCV among IDUs.

AB  - This paper focuses on the evidence for the effectiveness of community-based outreach intervention as one component of a comprehensive HIV prevention model for preventing HIV infection in injecting drug user (IDU) Populations. Three empirical questions guided the review of the evidence. This article includes primarily published literature on community-based outreach derived mostly from developing countries but also unpublished literature. Wherever possible, evidence from multi-country, multi-site studies or meta-analytical studies is included. More than 40 published studies reveal that injecting drug users (IDUs), who are reached by community-based outreach and provided with access to risk reduction services, report reducing HIV risk behaviours. The strength of the evidence was assessed using Hill's criteria, which permit a review of multiple studies with different designs. Using the criteria, it is possible to infer causation about the evidence of effectiveness of the intervention. The evidence for the effectiveness of a community-based outreach strategy is strong. Despite evidence from 20 years of evaluation studies of the effectiveness of community-based outreach, a huge gap exists in most countries between the number of IDUs who want or could benefit from outreach services and the number of IDUs who actually receive them. Findings from evaluation studies on the effectiveness of community-based outreach must be made accessible, disseminated globally and provided to policy- and decision-makers to persuade them to take action and implement scaled-up prevention programmes. This requires ongoing advocacy and constant strengthening of the evidence base. Plans are needed to link evidence-based findings with technical assistance as well as training to enhance the capacity of regions and countries to introduce, scale up and sustain HIV prevention outreach to IDUs as part of a comprehensive HIM prevention strategy.

AB  - This study examines drug acquisition and multiperson use of paraphernalia, drugs, and needles/syringes. Ethnographers observed 54 injection episodes in which IDUs were linked by HIV risk behaviors, and developed a typology of higher-risk, lower-risk, and nonsharing-risk networks. Multiperson use of injection paraphernalia or drug solution occurred in most injection events (94%). Serial use of syringes/needles occurred infrequently (14%) relative to "backloading" (37%) and reuse of paraphernalia (cookers 84%, cotton 77%, water 77%). Higher-risk injection networks were characterized by larger size and pooling of resources for drugs. Prevention messages must include avoiding reuse of injection paraphernalia and transfer of drug solution.

AB  - Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, questioning, and other sexual and gender minority youth (LGBTQ) experience myriad health inequities relative to their cisgender heterosexual peers. Families have a profound impact on adolescent health, but little is known about this influence on LGBTQ youth specifically. We draw on work presented at a public symposium that aimed to characterize existing scientific evidence, identify gaps in knowledge, and set priority areas for future research on the influence of family factors on LGBTQ youth health. We review the evidence in each identified priority area and propose promising avenues for future research and opportunities for innovation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is sparse evidence that demonstrates the association between macro-environmental processes and drug-related HIV epidemics. The present study explores the relationship between economic, socio-economic, policy and structural indicators, and increases in reported HIV infections among people who inject drugs (PWID) in the European Economic Area (EEA). METHODS: We used panel data (2003-2012) for 30 EEA countries. Statistical analyses included logistic regression models. The dependent variable was taking value 1 if there was an outbreak (significant increase in the national rate of HIV diagnoses in PWID) and 0 otherwise. Explanatory variables included the growth rate of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the share of the population that is at risk for poverty, the unemployment rate, the Eurostat S80/S20 ratio, the Gini coefficient, the per capita government expenditure on health and social protection, and variables on drug control policy and drug-using population sizes. Lags of one to three years were investigated. FINDINGS: In multivariable analyses, using two-year lagged values, we found that a 1% increase of GDP was associated with approximately 30% reduction in the odds of an HIV outbreak. In GDP-adjusted analyses with three-year lagged values, the effect of the national income inequality on the likelihood of an HIV outbreak was significant [S80/S20 Odds Ratio (OR) = 3.89; 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.15 to 13.13]. Generally, the multivariable analyses produced similar results across three time lags tested. INTERPRETATION: Given the limitations of ecological research, we found that declining economic growth and increasing national income inequality were associated with an elevated probability of a large increase in the number of HIV diagnoses among PWID in EEA countries during the last decade. HIV prevention may be more effective if developed within national and European-level policy contexts that promote income equality, especially among vulnerable groups.

AB  - This analysis assessed the utility of the limiting antigen avidity assay (LAg). Samples of people who inject drugs (PWID) in Greece with documented duration of HIV-1 infection were tested by LAg. A LAg-normalized optical density (ODn) ⩽1·5 corresponds to a recency window period of 130 days. The proportion true recent (PTR) and proportion false recent (PFR) were estimated in 28 seroconverters and in 366 samples collected >6 months after HIV diagnosis, respectively. The association between LAg ODn and HIV RNA level was evaluated in 232 persons. The PTR was 85·7%. The PFR was 20·8% but fell to 5·9% in samples from treatment-naive individuals with long-standing infection (>1 year), and to 0 in samples with the circulating recombinant form CRF35 AD. A LAg-based algorithm with a PFR of 3·3% estimated a similar incidence trend to that calculated by analyses based on HIV-1 seroconversions. In recently infected persons indicated by LAg, the median log10 HIV RNA level was high (5·30, interquartile range 4·56-5·90). LAg can help identify highly infectious HIV(+) individuals as it accurately identifies recent infections and is correlated with the HIV RNA level. It can also produce reliable estimates of HIV-1 incidence.

AB  - Early treatment, soon after infection, reduces HIV transmissions and benefits patients. The Transmission Reduction Intervention Project (TRIP) evaluated a network intervention to detect individuals recently infected (in the past 6 months). TRIP was conducted in Greece (2013-2015) and focused on drug injector networks. Based on HIV status, testing history, and the results of an assay to detect recent infections, TRIP classified drug injector "Seeds" into groups: Recent Seeds (RS), and Control Seeds with Long-term HIV infection (LCS). The network members of RS and LCS were traced for two steps. The analysis included 23 RS, 171 network members of the RS, 19 LCS, and 65 network members of the LCS. The per-seed number of recents detected in the network of RS was 5 times the number in the network of LCS (Ratio RS vs. LCS: 5.23; 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.54-27.61). The proportion of recents among HIV positives in the network of RS (27%) was approximately 3 times (Ratio RS vs. LCS: 3.30; 95% CI: 1.04-10.43) that in the network of LCS (8%). Strategic network tracing that starts with recently infected persons could support public health efforts to find and treat people early in their HIV infection.

AB  - Big Events are processes like macroeconomic transitions that have lowered social well-being in various settings in the past. Greece has been hit by the global crisis and experienced an HIV outbreak among people who inject drugs. Since the crisis began (2008), Greece has seen population displacement, inter-communal violence, cuts in governmental expenditures, and social movements. These may have affected normative regulation, networks, and behaviors. However, most pathways to risk remain unknown or unmeasured.

AB  - Early evidence of remote, volunteer-led social support interventions to reduce social isolation in older adults has been encouraging; however, evaluation data on outcomes related to social isolation associated from these interventions is scarce. Here, we share programmatic details of a novel, statewide initiative, called the NEST Collaborative, rolled out to meet immediate emotional, informational, and instrumental needs of older adults in Nevada during the COVID-19 pandemic. The evaluation included 31 older adults participating in weekly one-to-one empathy-based phone calls with multi-generational volunteers seeking to enhance participants' social networks through meaningful friendships. The calls were associated with programmatically meaningful, though not statistically significant, improvements in modified Hawthorne Friendship Scale and PHQ-2 Depression Scale scores over two waves of survey responses. These results suggest that social isolation and depression among older adults decreased among our sample over a period of increased isolation and mental health burden across the general population. With the potential for sustained impact in reducing social isolation over time, remote social support programs, such as the NEST Collaborative, may have persistent value long-term, beyond time-limited crisis response contexts.

AB  - Parenteral drug abusers are at risk for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), which is caused by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We tested stored sera for antibody to HIV (anti-HIV) using two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods and Western blot. The patients were parenteral drug abusers who had undergone percutaneous liver biopsy for chronic liver disease. Current or former alcohol abuse was noted in 88 (80%) of the 110 patients. The sensitivities of the two ELISA tests in comparison with Western blot, the more specific test for HIV, were 100 and 94%, respectively; the specificities were 94 and 99%. Western blot was positive in 36 (33%) of 110 patients. False-positive ELISA reactions for anti-HIV were seen in five (7%) of 70 patients with negative Western blot analyses. Compared to true-negatives, false-positives had significantly more years of alcohol abuse, younger ages of onset of alcohol abuse, greater frequencies of jaundice and edema, higher levels of alkaline phosphatase, total billirubin, total protein, and globulins, and lower levels of serum albumin. In a stepwise logistic regression, only hyperglobulinemia was significantly associated with a false-positive anti-HIV. We conclude that: (a) ELISA tests for anti-HIV are useful for screening abusers of alcohol and parenteral drugs with chronic liver disease for HIV infection, but positive results must be confirmed with more specific tests such as Western blot; (b) false-positive ELISA reactions in this population are associated with hyperglobulinemia; and (c) studies of HIV testing are needed in other populations of patients with alcoholism or liver disease.

AB  - Parenteral drug users have a high prevalence of infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the etiologic agent of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). New York City has had a prolonged and extensive epidemic of HIV infection and AIDS. In this study, we analyze, in relation to antibody to HIV (anti-HIV), available data from sera from parenteral drug users collected in New York City during 1978 through 1983 in the course of studies of liver disease. Among parenteral users of both heroin and cocaine, 30 (52%) of 58 had anti-HIV, compared with six (13%) of 48 injectors of heroin only (P less than 0.0001). Only two (11%) of 18 white patients were HIV-infected, compared with 34 (39%) of 88 black or Hispanic patients (P = 0.03). No other factors studied were linked to anti-HIV. In a multiple logistic regression, anti-HIV was significantly more common in parenteral users of both cocaine and heroin (P less than 0.0001), black patients (P = 0.02), and Hispanic patients (P = 0.049). We conclude that parenteral users of both cocaine and heroin as well as black and Hispanic patients were disproportionately HIV-infected during the early years of the HIV epidemic. Use of cocaine and heroin as well as ethnicity were independently linked to anti-HIV. Measures to prevent or treat drug use, HIV infection, and other medical problems while addressing the specific needs of cocaine users and black and Hispanic patients are urgently needed.

AB  - Coverage is an important dimension in measuring the effectiveness of needle and syringe programmes in providing sterile injecting equipment for people who inject drugs. The World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) currently recommend methods for measuring coverage at the population level, that is, across an estimated population of people who inject drugs within a given geographical area. However, population-level measures of coverage rely on highly uncertain population estimates and cannot capture the different levels of syringe acquisition and injecting episodes among individual users. Consequently, such measures only broadly evaluate the extent of programme service delivery, rather than describe how people who inject drugs as individuals and sub-groups interact with needle and syringe programmes. In response to these limitations, several researchers have proposed measuring coverage at the individual level, by the percentage of injecting episodes in relation to the number of sterile needles and syringes acquired. These measures evaluate coverage according to each individual's needs. Such measures provide enhanced information for planning and monitoring of harm reduction programmes and have now been used in multiple international research studies. We advise that WHO, UNODC and UNAIDS add individual-level coverage measurement methods to their international monitoring guidelines for harm reduction programmes. By doing this, more responsive and effective programmes can be created to better reduce injecting risk behaviours and blood-borne virus transmission among people who inject drugs.

AB  - Despite the high incidence of HIV among young Black MSM in the United States and engagement in high risk behaviors, many men in this group avoid infection. This suggests that some men may engage in systematic risk reduction behaviors when not always using condoms or abstaining from substances. Using a "positive deviance" framework, we conducted qualitative interviews with HIV-negative, Black MSM between 25 and 35 who reported unprotected anal sex and drug use in the past six months or current heavy drinking (N = 29) to discover behaviors that could facilitate remaining HIV-uninfected. Findings showed that MSM who remain HIV negative despite continuing to engage in high-risk behaviors may be engaging in adaptive risk reduction behaviors that, through successive decisions and advance planning along the timeline to a sexual event, could lead to increased condom use, avoidance or delay of a risky sexual event, or reduction of HIV positive partners.

AB  - Activation of the innate immune system, even by relatively innocuous stimuli, stimulates the release of cytokines (e.g. TNF) that can injure or kill the host. To maintain homeostasis, mammals have evolved a counter-regulatory response that suppresses the development of excessively robust inflammation. Fetuin, a 66-kD negative acute phase glycoprotein, was first identified in 1944. We recently discovered an anti-inflammatory role for fetuin, because it suppressed the release of TNF from lipopolysaccharide- (LPS) stimulated macrophages. Here the anti-inflammatory effects of fetuin were studied in vivo in an LPS-independent model of acute inflammation caused by administration of carrageenan. Administration of fetuin (5-500 mg/kg intraperitoneally) dose-dependently attenuated the development of paw edema as compared to either asialofetuin (500 mg/kg) or bovine albumin (500 mg/kg). TNF production in the carrageenan-injected paws was significantly inhibited by administration of fetuin (586+/-98 pg TNF/paw) as compared to either asialofetuin (1018+/-186 pg TNF/paw) or saline (1,005+/-172 pg TNF/paw). When specific anti-fetuin IgG was administered into the paw prior to the application of carrageenan, the development of edema formation was significantly increased as compared to irrelevant IgG, indicating that endogenous fetuin normally attenuates the inflammatory response. These results now reveal a previously unrecognized anti-inflammatory role of fetuin in counter-regulating the innate immune response, and suggest that it may be possible to use fetuin as an experimental anti-inflammatory agent.

AB  - Previous research has suggested that multiple stressors may work in tandem to affect the health of women who have sex with women (WSWs). WSWs have been a part of the HIV epidemic in New York City since the beginning, making it an ideal setting to further explore these women's risk. Among a sample of 375 heroin, crack and/or cocaine using women recruited from economically disadvantaged communities in New York City, we examined HIV seroprevalence and risk behaviors among WSWs as compared to women who have sex with men only (WSMOs). We also explore differences between WSWs and WSMOs with respect to potential stressors (i.e., decreased access to resources and health care utilization and violence victimization) that might contribute overall HIV risk. The study's limitations are noted.

AB  - Whether cardiovascular (CV) disease is associated with clinical outcomes in cancer patients receiving immunotherapy is unknown. We reviewed the Mayo Clinic database for all cancer patients who received an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI). Multivariate logistic regression analysis, survival analyses, and Cox proportional-hazards models were formulated. Between March, 2010 and July, 2019, 3,326 patients received ICI. Mean patient age was 63.5 years (range: 16 to 96 years). In a Cox proportional-hazards model, obesity (hazard ratio [HR] 0.65, 95% confidence level [CI] 0.55 to 0.77, p < 0.001) and hypercholesterolemia (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.89, p < 0.001) were associated with lower all-cause mortality while hypertension (HR 1.32, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.49, p < 0.001) and smoking (HR 1.17, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.29, p = 0.002) were associated with higher overall mortality. Among patients with lung cancer, multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios for death from any cause for beta blocker users, as compared with patients who had never used a beta blocker, were 1.39 (95% CI 1.10 to 1.76, p = 0.006). A total of 80 patients (2.4%) experienced CV immune-related adverse events. Event-related morality for ICI-induced myocarditis was 41.7% (5/12). Multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios for ICI-induced myocarditis were 5.2 (95% CI 1.4 to 18.7, p = 0.01) for history of heart failure, 4.06 (95% CI 1.15 to 14.3, p = 0.03) for history of acute coronary syndrome, and 1.07 (per each 1-year increase, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.14, p = 0.02) for age. In conclusion, our study shows that CV factors are associated with clinical outcomes in cancer patients receiving ICI and could be used to predict mortality. In patients with lung cancer, pretreatment beta blocker use is associated with higher all-cause mortality. Three clinical factors-history of heart failure, history of acute coronary syndrome, and age greater than 80 years-help identify patients at higher risk of ICI-induced myocarditis who might benefit from more intensive cardiac surveillance.

AB  - Objectives: Discrimination, such as being treated unfairly due to race, contributes to stress. Individuals may cope with this by engaging in risky behaviors. Consistent with this premise, prior studies found that discrimination is associated with substance use. Research has also shown that sex while 'high' on alcohol and drugs is associated with increased risk for HIV and other STIs. The present study examines the relationship between discrimination and sexual risk. We investigate whether discrimination is associated with sex while high on alcohol and drugs. Design: Analyses focus on a sample of 356 Caribbean Diasporic young adults, primarily Caribbean Latinx, aged 18 to 25 who participated in the Drug Use and HIV Risk among Youth Survey carried out from 1997 to 2000 in Brooklyn, New York. Logistic regression examined the association between self-reported discrimination and sex while high. Results: More than half (52.3%) of respondents reported moderate discrimination. Sex while high was also reported: 35.7% for alcohol, 43.3% for marijuana, and 32.6% for heroin/cocaine. Discrimination was associated with increased risk of sex while high on (1) marijuana and (2) heroin/cocaine, but was not with alcohol. Conclusions: Discrimination may be a risk factor for engaging in sex while high on drugs, which may put individuals at risk for HIV as well as other STIs. Future research should explore relationships between discrimination and sex while high on alcohol and drugs among various racial/ethnic groups and Diasporas, while also assessing how this relationship may contribute to HIV incidence.

AB  - A dentin-bonding root canal sealer (ZUT) has been developed, consisting of an experimental glass ionomer cement (KT-308) and an antimicrobial silver-containing zeolite (0.2% by weight). This in vitro study evaluated the ability of ZUT used with or without gutta-percha, to resist bacterial ingress of Enterococcus faecalis over a period of 90 days. Canals of 80 single-rooted teeth were prepared with apical patency and filled as follows (n = 10): KT-308 alone; KT-308 with a single gutta-percha cone (SCGP); ZUT alone; ZUT with SCGP; AH26 alone; AH26 with SCGP; positive control-no root canal filling; and negative control-no root canal filling, with the apices of this group sealed with C&B Metabond cement. Teeth were coated with nail polish except for the apical 2 mm, and each tooth was sealed in a 4-ml glass vial, with an 18-gauge needle inserted through the vial cover and bonded into the pulp chamber with C&B Metabond cement. After sterilization with 2.5 Mrad gamma-radiation, Brain Heart Infusion broth with phenol red was injected into each vial. An inoculum of E. faecalis was pipetted through the needle into the pulp chamber every 5 days, and the broth was monitored daily for color change and turbidity. When change occurred, the broth was cultured for growth of E. faecalis. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and the log-rank test revealed no significant differences among the three sealers used. The presence of gutta-percha, however, significantly improved resistance to bacterial ingress through obturated root canals (X, p < 0.05). Under the conditions of this study, the hypothesized advantage of ZUT (0.2% zeolite) was not demonstrated.

AB  - The Caribbean has the highest HIV rates outside of sub-Saharan Africa. In recent decades, tourism has become the most important Caribbean industry, Studies suggest that tourism areas are epicenters of demographic and social changes linked to HIV risk, such as transactional sex, elevated alcohol and substance use, and internal migration. Despite this, no formative HIV-prevention studies have examined tourism areas as ecologies that heighten HIV vulnerability. HIV/AIDS research needs to place emphasis on the ecological context of sexual vulnerability in tourism areas and develop multilevel interventions that are sensitive to this context. From our review and integration of a broad literature across the social and health sciences, we argue for an ecological approach to sexual health in Caribbean tourism areas, point to gaps in knowledge, and provide direction for future research.

AB  - Purpose of Review Status-neutral care, a person-centered approach to healthcare not predicated on HIV serostatus, may improve health equity among Black sexual minority men (BSMM). We reviewed current status-neutral, HIV, and Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) interventions, and coded each for social-ecological focus and use of six approaches: (1) person-centered, (2) anti-stigma, (3) social support, (4) the social determinants of health (SDOH), (5) community engagement, and (6) multi-sectoral partnerships. Recent Findings We reviewed 25 studies, of which 3 were status-neutral. Nineteen studies utilized person-centered approaches, with several employing BSMM peers. For SDOH, financial incentives and reducing clinic-level barriers to care improved cascade outcomes. Direct text messaging, anti-stigma, social support, community-engagement, and multi-sectoral partnerships also improved outcomes in some studies. Few status-neutral programs exist and additional research is needed to identify key intervention components and mechanisms of influence. Programs targeting SDOH and multiple social-ecological levels offer promise for providing holistic care to BSMM, while addressing HIV prevention and treatment and health equity.

AB  - Alcohol and marijuana are two of the most prevalent psychoactive substances and each may result in distinct psychosocial and physical sexual experiences and different sexual risk behaviors. With marijuana becoming more accepted in the US along with more liberal state-level policies, it is important to examine and compare users' psychosocial and physical sexual experiences and sexual risk behavior associated with these drugs. In this study, we interviewed 24 adults who recently used marijuana before sex. Participants were 50 % female and all self-identified as heterosexual and HIV-negative. Using thematic analysis, we compared self-reported psychosocial and physical sexual experiences of alcohol and marijuana. Participants described differences between drugs with regard to psychosocial (e.g., partner interactions and contexts before sex, partner choice, perceived attractiveness of self and others, disinhibition, and feelings of regret after sex) and physical sexual experiences (e.g., sexual dysfunction, dose effects, sensations of body/sex organs, length and intensity of sex, and orgasm). Alcohol use was commonly associated with social outgoingness and use facilitated connections with potential sexual partners; however, alcohol was more likely than marijuana to lead to atypical partner choice or post-sex regret. Both alcohol and marijuana had a variety of negative sexual effects, and the illegality of marijuana reportedly facilitated intimate encounters. While sexual experiences tended to be similar across males and females, we did find some variation by gender. Results can inform prevention and harm reduction programming that will allow us to design more realistic programs and to craft interventions, which guide potential users to make safer choices.

AB  - Serial samples from human immunodeficiency virus-infected infants in the first year of life were analyzed by quantitative human immunodeficiency virus polymerase chain reaction assays. Very high, persistent levels of plasma RNA and proviral DNA were detected throughout the study period, suggesting the absence of an effective immune response, Most patients had normal CD4 lymphocyte counts and were symptom free for the first 3 to 6 months despite high levels of viral replication. These findings support the evaluation of early intervention (before symptoms develop) and efforts to establish the predictive value of these assays.

AB  - Although the vast majority of injection drug users (IDUs) attending syringe exchange programs in New York City have stopped risky injection (injecting with syringes used by someone else), there remains a subgroup of IDUs who continue to engage in high-risk injecting behaviors despite access to sterile syringes. Subjects were randomly recruited from five legally authorized syringe exchange programs in New York City between October 1992 and August 1994. Participants were asked about drug and sexual risk behavior 30 days prior to their first use of the syringe exchange as well as during the 30-day period prior to the interview while using the exchange. Of the 2,465 participants, 77.4% reported no risky injection during the 30 days prior to using syringes exchange. For this analysis we included only those who reported risky injection for the 30-day period prior to using syringe exchange (N = 556). We compared sociodemographics and behavioral characteristics of a group who continued risky injection while using the syringe exchange, "continuers," N = 158 (28.8%) with a group who reported risky injection prior to using the exchange and then ceased risky injection while using the exchange, "stoppers," N = 391(71.2%). Continuers were significantly more likely to report passing on dirty syringes to social network members and to inject cocaine at least daily. We present other predictors of continued risk and discuss the implications for interventions and make recommendations for syringe exchange programs.

AB  - HIV among injecting drug users (IDUs) has now been documented in over 60 countries in the world, and there are an additional 40 countries where injecting drug use has been reported including widespread epidemics in Southeast and southern Asia and in Latin America. At present HIV infection is almost always fatal, and there is no promise that a preventive vaccine will become available soon. Given the enormity of the HIV epidemic among IDUs and the critical need to reduce the spread of HIV transmission to and from IDUs, prevention efforts are essential. Syringe-exchange programs have become a major component of HIV prevention strategies in most developed countries and work within the philosophy of harm reduction. Increasing access to sterile syringes has been met with considerable controversy. Opponents of syringe exchange have generally argued that increasing access to sterile syringes would simultaneously increase the number of injecting drug users, increase the frequency of injection for already active IDUs, and appear to "condone" an illegal behavior. To date many research studies and four major reviews of syringe exchange literature have been conducted. All studies thus far have shown no increase in illicit drug injection associated with syringe exchanges, and significant decrease in drug risk behaviors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: High numbers of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infections among people who inject drugs (PWID) have been diagnosed in Athens, Greece, since 2011. We aimed to trace the geographic origin of HIV-1 infection for migrants who inject drugs and to investigate whether transmissions occur more frequently among migrants than among Greek nationals. METHODS: Multiple cross-sectional studies were pooled to assemble all persons diagnosed with HIV-1 in Greece between 1 January 2011 and 31 October 2014. Phylogenetic analyses used maximum likelihood estimation. The hypothesis of ethnic compartmentalization was tested by reconstructing ancestral states of characters at the tips using the criterion of parsimony over a set of bootstrap trees. RESULTS: Of 2274 persons, 38.4% were PWID. Phylogenetic analyses showed the existence of 4 major PWID-specific local transmission networks (LTNs): CRF14_BG (437 [58.6%]), CRF35_AD (139 [18.6%]), subtype B (116 [15.6%]), and subtype A (54 [7.2%]). Of 184 non-Greek PWID, 78.3% had been infected within the PWID-LTNs. For 173 (94.3%), the origin of their infection was assumed to be in Greece (postmigration). For PWID infected within LTNs, transmissions for subtype A and CRF14_BG occurred more frequently among migrants than would be expected by chance (phyloethnic study). CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis showed that the majority of infections among migrants occurred postmigration. The existence of significant transmission networking among migrants highlights that this population is a priority for HIV prevention. As molecular analysis can estimate the probable country of HIV infection, it can help to inform the design of public health strategies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: During 2011, a dramatic increase (1600%) of reported HIV-1 infections among injecting drug users (IDUs) was noted in Athens, Greece. We herein assess the potential causal pathways associated with this outbreak. METHODS: Our study employed high resolution HIV-1 phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses. We examined also longitudinal data of ecological variables such as the annual growth of gross domestic product (GDP) of Greece in association with HIV-1 and HCV sentinel prevalence in IDUs, unemployment and homelessness rates and HIV transmission networks in Athens IDUs before and during economic recession (2008-2012). RESULTS: IDU isolates sampled in 2011 and 2012 suggested transmission networks in 94.6% and 92.7% of the cases in striking contrast with the sporadic networking (5%) during 1998-2009. The geographic origin of most HIV-1 isolates was consistent with the recently documented migratory waves in Greece. The decline in GDP was inversely correlated with annual prevalence rates of HIV and HCV and with unemployment and homelessness rates in IDUs (all p<0.001). The slope of anti-HCV prevalence in the sentinel populations of IDUs and in "new" drug injectors was found 120 and 1.9-fold (p = 0.007, p = 0.08 respectively) higher in 2008-2012 (economic recession) compared with 2002-2006. The median (25th, 75th) size of transmission networks were 34 (12, 58) and 2 (2, 2) (p = 0.057) in 2008-2012 and 1998-2007, respectively. The coverage of harm reduction services was low throughout the study period. CONCLUSIONS: Scaling-up harm reduction services and addressing social and structural factors related to the current economic crisis should be urgently considered in environments where HIV-1 outbreaks may occur.

AB  - New diagnoses of HIV-1 infection among people who inject drugs (PWID) rocketed in Athens, Greece between 2011 and 2014 (HIV-1 outbreak). Our aim was to identify, during that period, potential cross-group transmissions between the within-Greece PWID and other risk or national groups using molecular methods. Sequences from 33 PWID were outside the PWID-outbreak networks in Greece (PWID-imported transmissions). Phylogenetic analyses on 28 of these sequences (subtypes A and B) showed that 11 subtype B infections originated from Greece, whereas 8 and 7 subtype A strains were from former Soviet Union countries (A(FSU)) and Greece, respectively. The putative source in half of the PWID-imported transmissions with Greek origin was an individual who acquired HIV via sexual contact. During four years of an HIV-1 outbreak among PWID in Athens, Greece, 33 individuals in this group (4.6% of all diagnoses with phylogenetic analyses) are likely to represent infections, sexually or injection-acquired, outside the within-Greece-PWID-outbreak networks. Combined molecular and traditional HIV surveillance to monitor introductions of new strains, and interventions that aim at reducing the rate of both injection and sexual risky practices are needed during drug injection-related HIV outbreaks.

AB  - AIM: Several injectable materials have been used as osteogenic bone substitutes. However, none has gained universal acceptance. This study was performed to investigate whether or not chitosan-alginate gel/mesenchymal stem cells/bone morphogenetic protein-2 composites are potentially injectable materials for new bone formation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The composites were injected into the subcutaneous space on the dorsum of nude mice to investigate new bone tissue formation. The composites were examined histologically over a 12-week period. RESULTS: The composites injected into the mouse were able to stimulate new bone formation, which was trabecular in type. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that chitosan-alginate gel/MSCs/BMP-2 composites could become clinically useful injectable materials to generate new bone.

AB  - AIM OF THIS STUDY: Aralia cordata has been used to alleviate symptoms of osteoarthritis (OA) in traditional medicine. However, there is no in vivo study related with the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of Aralia cordata. On the basis of this background, our study was designed to examine the cartilage protective and proliferative effects of Aralia cordata by using a collagenase-induced osteoarthritis (CIA) rabbit model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The right knees of rabbits were injected intra-articularly with collagenase, and rabbits were orally administered with distilled water (vehicle), Aralia cordata (200mg/kg) and celecoxib (100mg/kg) once a day for 28 days after the initiation of the CIA. RESULTS: In histopathologic studying by using H&E and Safranin O staining, Aralia cordata showed a cartilage protective effect in CIA rabbit femoral condyle. However, celecoxib had no effect on cartilage protection in CIA. The inflammatory mediators involved in cartilage destruction, such as COX-2 and PGE(2), were inhibited in the Aralia cordata-treated group. Aralia cordata also showed an anti-apoptotic effect through suppression of caspase-3 activity and chondrocyte proliferation induction in both in vivo and in vitro. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that Aralia cordata showed cartilage protective effects through the down-regulations of COX-2 expression, PGE(2) production, caspase-3 activity, and chondrocyte proliferation in the CIA rabbit model.

AB  - Background: The increasing rate of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) is a threat to the public health and TB control. In Korea, about 75 similar to 80% of TB patients are treated in private hospitals and the rate has been continuously increasing since 2000. Methods: On a retrospective basis, we enrolled 170 newly diagnosed with or retreated for multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) in 2004 from 21 private hospitals. We extracted the following demographics and treatment history from patient medical records: initial treatment outcomes, cumulative survival rates, treatment outcomes, and prognostic factors. Results: Of the 170 patients, the majority were male (64.1%), the mean age was 44.5 years old, and mean body-mass-index was 20.2 kg/m(2). None of the patients tested positive for HIV. Eleven (6.5%) were confirmed to have extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) at treatment initiation. Treatment success rates were not different between XDR-TB (36.4%, 4/11) and non-XDR MDR-TB (51.6%, 82/159). Default rate was high, 21.8% (37/170). Far advanced disease on X-ray was a significant negative predictor of treatment success; advanced disease and low BMI were risk factors for all-cause mortality. Conclusion: In private hospitals in Korea, the proportion of XDR-TB in MDR-TB was comparable to previous data. The treatment success rate of MDR-/XDR-TB remains poor and the failure rate was quite high. Adequate TB control policies should be strengthened to prevent the further development and spread of MDR-/XDR-TB in Korea.

AB  - The main pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease is the deposition of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides in the brain. Aβ has been widely used to mimic several aspects of Alzheimer's disease. However, several characteristics of amyloid-induced Alzheimer's disease pathology are not well established, especially in mice. The present study aimed to develop a new Alzheimer's disease model by investigating how Aβ can be effectively aggregated using prokaryotes and eukaryotes. To express the Aβ42 complex in HEK293 cells, we cloned the Aβ42 region in a tandem repeat and incorporated the resulting construct into a eukaryotic expression vector. Following transfection into HEK293 cells via lipofection, cell viability assay and western blotting analysis revealed that exogenous Aβ42 can induce cell death and apoptosis. In addition, recombinant His-tagged Aβ42 was successfully expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and not only readily formed Aβ complexes, but also inhibited the proliferation of SH-SY5Y cells and E. coli. For in vivo testing, recombinant His-tagged Aβ42 solution (3 μg/μl in 1× PBS containing 1 mM Ni²⁺) was injected stereotaxically into the left and right lateral ventricles of the brains of C57BL/6J mice (n = 8). Control mice were injected with 1× PBS containing 1 mM Ni²⁺ following the same procedure. Ten days after the sample injection, the Morris water maze test confirmed that exogenous Aβ caused an increase in memory loss. These findings demonstrated that Ni²⁺ is capable of complexing the 50-kDa amyloid and that intracerebroventricular injection of Aβ42 can lead to cognitive impairment, thereby providing improved Alzheimer's disease models.

AB  - AIM: To determine the safety profile of new hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatments in liver transplant (LT) recipients with recurrent HCV infection. METHODS: Forty-two patients were identified with recurrent HCV infection that underwent LT at least 12 mo prior to initiating treatment with a Sofosbuvir-based regimen during December 2013-June 2014. Cases were patients who experienced hepatic decompensation and/or serious adverse events (SAE) during or within one month of completing treatment. Controls had no evidence of hepatic decompensation and/or SAE. HIV-infected patients were excluded. Cumulative incidence of decompensation/SAE was calculated using the Kaplan Meier method. Exact logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with the composite outcome. RESULTS: Median age of the 42 patients was 60 years [Interquartile Range (IQR): 56-65 years], 33% (14/42) were female, 21% (9/42) were Hispanic, and 9% (4/42) were Black. The median time from transplant to treatment initiation was 5.4 years (IQR: 2.1-8.8 years). Thirteen patients experienced one or more episodes of hepatic decompensation and/or SAE. Anemia requiring transfusion, the most common event, occurred in 62% (8/13) patients, while 54% (7/13) decompensated. The cumulative incidence of hepatic decompensation/SAE was 31% (95%CI: 16%-41%). Risk factors for decompensation/SAE included lower pre-treatment hemoglobin (OR = 0.61 per g/dL, 95%CI: 0.40-0.88, P < 0.01), estimated glomerular filtration rate (OR = 0.95 per mL/min per 1.73 m(2), 95%CI: 0.90-0.99, P = 0.01), and higher baseline serum total bilirubin (OR = 2.43 per mg/dL, 95%CI: 1.17-8.65, P < 0.01). The sustained virological response rate for the cohort of 42 patients was 45%, while it was 31% for cases. CONCLUSION: Sofosbuvir/ribavirin will continue to be used in the post-transplant population, including those with HCV genotypes 2 and 3. Management of anemia remains an important clinical challenge.

AB  - Aims: To determine if measures of drug use risk, sexual risk, external norms and internalized norms developed for impoverished neighbourhoods of New York are usable in similar neighbourhoods of Buenos Aires and have similar associations with each other in the two cities despite the many cultural, social, economic and political differences between these localities. Methods: In 2003-2004, 240 current non-injection drug users (IDUs) and 63 current IDUs, aged 21-35 years, were interviewed in poor neighbourhoods of the Southern Metropolitan Area of Buenos Aires about their drug use, sexual behaviours, internalized norms and external norms (actual and perceived social pressures from others) using measures developed in New York (Flom, Friedman, Benny, & Curtis, 2001a, Flom, et al., 2001b; Flom, Friedman, Jose, Neaigus, & Curtis, 2001c). Analyses studied associations between a hierarchical scale of drug use risk and the other variables. Results: The hierarchical risk scale of drug use was associated with sexual risk behaviours; with external norms towards drug injection and sex with drug injectors, and internalized norms about social distance from drug injectors. Conclusions: The hierarchical drug use risk scale and the measures of external norms had relationships similar to those found in the earlier studies in New York City. This supports the ideas that these measures may have a degree of cross-cultural applicability.

AB  - T20, a synthetic peptide corresponding to a C-terminal segment of the envelope glycoprotein (gp41) of human and simian immunodeficiency viruses, is a potent inhibitor of viral infection. We report here that C-terminal octylation of simian immunodeficiency virus gp41-derived T20 induces a significant increase in its inhibitory potency. Furthermore, when C-terminally octylated, an otherwise inactive mutant in which the C-terminal residues GNWF were replaced by ANAA has potency similar to that of the wild type T20. This effect cannot be explained by a trivial inhibitory effect of the octyl group added to the peptides, because the N-terminally octylated peptides have the same activity as the non-octylated parent peptides. The effects caused by octylation on the oligomerization, secondary structure, and membrane-interaction properties of the peptides were investigated. Our results shed light on the mechanism of inhibition by T20 and provide experimental support for the existence of a pre-hairpin intermediate.

AB  - AIMS: To assess audio computer-assisted self-interviewing (A-CASI) as a mode of data collection with injecting drug users (IDUs) entering two drug treatment programs in New York City. A-CASI has been found to increase reporting of sensitive items among a variety of population subgroups. DESIGN: A field test of A-CASI data collection conducted within an ongoing cross-sectional study of drug use and HIV risk behaviors among IDUs entering drug treatment. Participants were assigned without bias to either a computer-assisted interviewer-administered personal interview (CAPI) or to a mixed CAPI/A-CASI interview. In the latter, 'sensitive' portions (dealing with stigmatized behavior) of the questionnaire were self-administered through A-CASI, while the remaining portions were interviewer-administered. SETTING: The Detoxification Program and the Methadone Maintenance Treatment Program (MMTP) at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York City. PARTICIPANTS: Seven hundred and eighty-three IDUs entering drug treatment. MEASUREMENTS: Odds ratios and adjusted odds ratios (controlling for demographic differences) for comparison of A-CASI versus CAPI responses on 111 sensitive questions. FINDINGS: Twenty-three statistically significant differences (each at P < 0.05), all in the direction of more reporting of the behaviors by the A-CASI group. Forty-one per cent of A-CASI participants said they would prefer any subsequent interviews to be fully A-CASI and 46% said they would prefer the mixed CAPI/A-CASI mode. CONCLUSIONS: A-CASI was associated with greater reporting of potentially stigmatized drug, sex and HIV risk behaviors on a moderate number of questions. Moreover, a large majority of participants who used A-CASI would like to be assigned to this method of data collection in future interviews.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Genetic testing will soon enter care for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), and for addiction. There is a paucity of data on how to disseminate genetic testing into healthcare for marginalized populations. We explored drug users' perceptions of genetic testing. METHODS: Six focus groups were conducted with 34 drug users recruited from syringe exchange programmes and an HIV clinic between May and June 2012. Individual interviews were conducted with participants reporting previous genetic testing. RESULTS: All participants expressed acceptance of genetic testing to improve care, but most had concerns regarding confidentiality and implications for law enforcement. Most expressed more comfort with genetic testing based on individual considerations rather than testing based on race/ethnicity. Participants expressed comfort with genetic testing in medical care rather than drug treatment settings and when specifically asked permission, with peer support, and given a clear rationale. CONCLUSION: Although participants understood the potential value of genetic testing, concerns regarding breaches in confidentiality and discrimination may reduce testing willingness. Safeguards against these risks, peer support, and testing in medical settings based on individual factors and with clear rationales provided may be critical in efforts to promote acceptance of genetic testing among drug users.

AB  - Background & Aims: Many foreign-born persons in the US are at high risk of chronic hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) infections, yet are not aware of their infection, and lack healthcare coverage or linkage to care. Methods: A unique partnership, the Hepatitis Outreach Network, combines the expertise and resources of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, and community-based organizations, to provide education, screening and link to care in communities with high prevalence of chronic viral hepatitis. Comprehensive HBV and HCV screening identifies infected patients, who then receive further evaluation from either local or Mount Sinai physicians, combined with patient-navigators who organize follow-up visits. Results: Of 1603 persons screened, 76 had HBV and 75 had HCV. Importantly, screening for HCV based on traditional risk factors would have missed 67% of those who tested positive. Of the 76 persons with HCV infection, 49 (64%) received a medical evaluation (26 with local providers and 23 at Mount Sinai). Of the 49 HCV-infected persons evaluated, treatment was recommended in 11 and begun in 8 (73%). Of the 76 persons with HBV infection, 43 (57%) received a medical evaluation (31 with local providers and 12 at Mount Sinai). Of the 43 HBV-infected persons evaluated, treatment was recommended and begun in 5 (100%). Conclusions: Hepatitis Outreach Network has successfully established novel proof of concept for identifying HBV and HCV infections in foreign-born persons through use of several unique elements that effectively link them to care.

AB  - Individuals with a history of opioid use are disproportionately represented in Illinois jails and prisons and face high risks of overdose and relapse at community reentry. Case management and peer recovery coaching are established interventions that may be leveraged to improve linkage to substance use treatment and supportive services during these critical periods of transition. We present the protocol for the Reducing Opioid Mortality in Illinois (ROMI), a type I hybrid effectiveness-implementation randomized trial of a case management, peer recovery coaching and overdose education and naloxone distribution (CM/PRC + OEND) critical time intervention (CTI) compared to OEND alone. The CM/PRC + OEND is a novel, 12-month intervention that involves linkage to substance use treatment and support for continuity of care, skills building, and navigation and engagement of social services that will be implemented using a hub-and-spoke model of training and supervision across the study sites. At least 1000 individuals released from jails and prisons spanning urban and rural settings will be enrolled. The primary outcome is engagement in medication for opioid use disorder. Secondary outcomes include health insurance enrollment, mental health service engagement, and re-arrest/recidivism, parole violation, and/or reincarceration. Mixed methods will be used to evaluate process and implementation outcomes including fidelity to, barriers to, facilitators of, and cost of the intervention. Videoconferencing and other remote processes will be leveraged to modify the protocol for safety during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results of the study may improve outcomes for vulnerable persons at the margin of behavioral health and the criminal legal system.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) is being widely adopted in high TB burden countries. Analysis is needed to guide the placement of devices within health systems to optimize the tuberculosis (TB) case detection rate (CDR). METHODS: We used epidemiological and operational data from Uganda (139 sites serving 87,600 individuals tested for TB) to perform a model-based comparison of the following placement strategies for Xpert devices: 1) Health center level (sites ranked by size from national referral hospitals to health care level III centers), 2) Smear volume (sites ranked from highest to lowest volume of smear microscopy testing), 3) Antiretroviral therapy (ART) volume (sites ranked from greatest to least patients on ART), 4) External equality assessment (EQA) performance (sites ranked from worst to best smear microscopy performance) and 5) TB prevalence (sites ranked from highest to lowest). We compared two clinical algorithms, one where Xpert was used only for smear microscopy negative samples versus another replacing smear microscopy. The primary outcome was TB CDR; secondary outcomes were detection of multi-drug resistant TB, number of sites requiring device placement to achieve specified rollout coverage, and cost. RESULTS: Placement strategies that prioritized sites with higher TB prevalence maximized CDR, with an incremental rate of 6.2-12.6% compared to status quo (microscopy alone). Diagnosis of MDR-TB was greatest in the TB Prevalence strategy when Xpert was used in place of smear microscopy. While initial implementation costs were lowest in the Smear Volume strategy, cost per additional TB case detected was lowest in the TB prevalence strategy. CONCLUSION: In Uganda, placement of Xpert devices in sites with high TB prevalence yielded the highest TB CDR at the lowest cost per additional case diagnosed. These results represent novel use of program level data to inform the optimal placement of new technology in resource-constrained settings.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Regimens for isoniazid-based preventive therapy (IPT) for tuberculosis (TB) in HIV-infected individuals have not been widely adopted given concerns regarding efficacy, adherence and drug resistance. Further, the cost-effectiveness of IPT has not been studied in India. METHODS: We used an HIV/TB model to project TB incidence, life expectancy, cost and incremental cost-effectiveness of six months of isoniazid plus ethambutol (6EH), thirty-six months of isoniazid (36H) and no IPT for HIV-infected patients in India. Model input parameters included a median CD4 count of 324 cells/mm(3), and a rate ratio of developing TB of 0.35 for 6EH and 0.22 for 36H at three years as compared to no IPT. Results of 6EH and 36H were also compared to six months of isoniazid (6H), three months of isoniazid plus rifampin (3RH) and three months of isoniazid plus rifapentine (3RPTH). RESULTS: Projected TB incidence decreased in the 6EH and 36H regimens by 51% and 62% respectively at three-year follow-up compared to no IPT. Without IPT, projected life expectancy was 136.1 months at a lifetime per person cost of $5,630. 6EH increased life expectancy by 0.8 months at an additional per person cost of $100 (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $1,490/year of life saved (YLS)). 36H further increased life expectancy by 0.2 months with an additional per person cost of $55 (ICER of $3,120/YLS). The projected clinical impact of 6EH was comparable to 6H and 3RH; however when compared to these other options, 6EH was no longer cost-effective given the high cost of ethambutol. Results were sensitive to baseline CD4 count and adherence. CONCLUSIONS: Three, six and thirty-six-month regimens of isoniazid-based therapy are effective in preventing TB. Three months of isoniazid plus rifampin and six-months of isoniazid are similarly cost-effective in India, and should be considered part of HIV care.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Propranolol (P) treatment exerts a preventive effect against the detrimental consequences to bone status in mildly chronically food-restricted growing rats (NGR) by an increment in cortical bone and by improving its spatial distribution. OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of beta-blocker on operational mechanism of bone mechanostat in an animal model of nutritional stress. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Weanling male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to four groups: control (C), C + P (CP), NGR and NGR + P (NGRP). C and CP rats were fed freely with the standard diet. NGR and NGRP rats received, for 4 weeks, 80% of the amount of food consumed by C and CP respectively, the previous day, corrected by body weight. Propranolol (7 mg/kg/day) was injected ip 5 days per week, for four weeks in CP and NGRP rats. C and NGR received saline injections at an identical dosage regimen. Body weight and length were determined during the experimental period. Dietary intake was registered daily. Animals were sacrificed after 4 weeks of food restriction. Immediately, cuadriceps, femur and tibiae from each animal were dissected and weighed, and histomorphometric and mechanical studies were performed. Serum a-CTX, osteocalcin, intact PTH, calcium and phosphorous were determined. Body protein (% prot) was measured in all groups. RESULTS: Food restriction induced detrimental effects on body and femoral growth, load-bearing capacity (Wf), % prot and cuadriceps weight in NGR us. C (p < 0.01). beta-blocker did not modify anthropometric and bone morphometric parameters in NGRP and CP us. NGR and C, respectively (p > 0.05). However, Wf NGRP vs. NGR was significantly higher (p < 0.01). alpha-CTX was significantly higher in NGR vs. C (p < 0.01). No significant differences were observed in alpha-CTX levels between CP, NGRP and C (p > 0.05). Serum osteocalcin, intact PTH, calcium and phospho- rous showed no significant difference between groups (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that modeling increase in bone mass and strength in NGRP rats could be due to an anticatabolic interaction of the beta-blocker propranolol on operational mechanism of bone mechanostat in an animal model of nutritional stress.

AB  - Purpose: Considerable evidence has shown that social networks influence a wide variety of health behaviors. This study investigates whether having friends with overweight/obesity in one's social network (network exposure) can predict changes in body mass index (BMI) throughout high school in a diverse urban population of students. Methods: Racially and ethnically diverse students from five high schools in Los Angeles County were surveyed at four time points throughout high school from 2010 to 2013 (N = 2091). Surveys included questions on students' social networks, demographics, and health-related information. BMI and weight categories were calculated for all students who provided height and weight information (∼50%). A latent growth curve model was used to assess the growth trajectory of BMI and the time-varying effect of network exposure to friends with overweight/obesity while controlling for demographic covariates. Results: Hispanic students had a significantly higher initial BMI compared with non-Hispanic students (p < 0.01). There was a significant positive slope for time on BMI growth (p < 0.01). Greater personal network exposure to friends with overweight/obesity was associated with a significant 0.65-point average increase in BMI (p < 0.05) at the first follow-up time point (T2) and a significant 0.62-point average increase in BMI (p < 0.01) at the last follow-up (T4) while controlling for covariates. Conclusions: Using structural equation modeling to understand the relationship between BMI and social networks, we found that increased network exposure to peers with overweight/obesity is associated with higher individual BMI, demonstrating that friendships may influence adolescents' weight status over time.

AB  - In 2016, the World Health Organization issued global elimination targets for hepatitis C virus (HCV), including an 80% reduction in HCV incidence by 2030. The vast majority of new HCV infections occur among people who inject drugs (PWID), and as such elimination strategies require particular focus on this population. As governments urgently require guidance on how to achieve elimination among PWID, mathematical modeling can provide critical information on the level and targeting of intervention are required. In this paper we review the epidemic modeling literature on HCV transmission and prevention among PWID, highlight main differences in mathematical formulation, and discuss key insights provided by these models in terms of achieving WHO elimination targets among PWID. Overall, the vast majority of modeling studies utilized a deterministic compartmental susceptible-infected-susceptible structure, with select studies utilizing individual-based network transmission models. In general, these studies found that harm reduction alone is unlikely to achieve elimination targets among PWID. However, modeling indicates elimination is achievable in a wide variety of epidemic settings with harm reduction scale-up combined with modest levels of HCV treatment for PWID. Unfortunately, current levels of testing and treatment are generally insufficient to achieve elimination in most settings, and require further scale-up. Additionally, network-based treatment strategies as well as prison-based treatment and harm reduction provision could provide important additional population benefits. Overall, epidemic modeling has and continues to play a critical role in informing HCV elimination strategies worldwide.

AB  - Little information exists on the population prevalence or geographic distribution of injection drug users (IDUs) who are Hispanic in the USA. Here, we present yearly estimates of IDU population prevalence among Hispanic residents of the 96 most populated US metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) for 1992-2002. First, yearly estimates of the proportion of IDUs who were Hispanic in each MSA were created by combining data on (1) IDUs receiving drug treatment services in Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)'s Treatment Entry Data System, (2) IDUs being tested in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) HIV-Counseling and Testing System, and (3) incident AIDS diagnoses among IDUs, supplemented by (4) data on IDUs who were living with AIDS. Then, the resulting proportions were multiplied by published yearly estimates of the number of IDUs of all racial/ethnic groups in each MSA to produce Hispanic IDU population estimates. These were divided by Hispanic population data to produce population prevalence rates. Time trends were tested using mixed-effects regression models. Hispanic IDU prevalence declined significantly on average (1992 mean = 192, median = 133; 2002 mean = 144, median = 93; units are per 10,000 Hispanics aged 15-64). The highest prevalence rates across time tended to be in smaller northeastern MSAs. Comparing the last three study years to the first three, prevalence decreased in 82% of MSAs and increased in 18%. Comparisons with data on drug-related mortality and hepatitis C mortality supported the validity of the estimates. Generally, estimates of Hispanic IDU population prevalence were higher than published estimates for non-Hispanic White residents and lower than published estimates for non-Hispanic Black residents. Further analysis indicated that the proportion of IDUs that was Hispanic decreased in 52% and increased in 48% of MSAs between 2002 and 2007. The estimates resulting from this study can be used to investigate MSA-level social and economic factors that may have contributed to variations across MSAs and to help guide prevention program planning for Hispanic IDUs within MSAs. Future research should attempt to determine to what extent these trends are applicable to Hispanic national origin subgroups.

AB  - Over the eight months following Hurricane Sandy, of October 2012, we interviewed 300 people who inject drugs in New York City. During the week after the storm, 28% rescued others or volunteered with aid groups; 60% experienced withdrawal; 27% shared drug injection or preparation equipment, or injected with people they normally would not inject with; 70% of those on opioid maintenance therapy could not obtain sufficient doses; and 43% of HIV-positive participants missed HIV medication doses. Although relatively brief, a hurricane can be viewed as a Big Event that can alter drug environments and behaviors, and may have lasting impact. The study's limitations are noted and future needed research is suggested.

AB  - Macro-social/structural events ("big events") such as wars, disasters, and large-scale changes in policies can affect HIV transmission by making risk behaviors more or less likely or by changing risk contexts. The purpose of this study was to develop new measures to investigate hypothesized pathways between macro-social changes and HIV transmission. We developed novel scales and indexes focused on topics including norms about sex and drug injecting under different conditions, involvement with social groups, helping others, and experiencing denial of dignity. We collected data from 300 people who inject drugs in New York City during 2012-2013. Most investigational measures showed evidence of validity (Pearson correlations with criterion variables range = 0.12-0.71) and reliability (Cronbach's alpha range = 0.62-0.91). Research is needed in different contexts to evaluate whether these measures can be used to better understand HIV outbreaks and help improve social/structural HIV prevention intervention programs.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We estimated race/ethnicity-specific incident AIDS diagnosis rates (IARs) among people who inject drugs (PWID) in U.S. metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) over time to assess the change in disparities after highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) dissemination. METHODS: We compared IARs and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for black/African American and Hispanic/Latino PWID with those of white PWID in 93 of the most populous MSAs. We selected two three-year periods from the years immediately preceding HAART (1993-1995) and the years with the most recent available data (2005-2007). To maximize stability, we aggregated data across three-year periods, and we aggregated data for black/African American and Hispanic/Latino PWID for most comparisons with data for white PWID. We assessed disparities by comparing IAR 95% CIs for overlap. RESULTS: IARs were significantly higher for black/African American and Hispanic/Latino PWID than for white PWID in 81% of MSAs in 1993-1995 and 77% of MSAs in 2005-2007. MSAs where disparities became non-significant over time were concentrated in the West. Significant differences were more frequent in comparisons between black/African American and white PWID (85% of MSAs in 1993-1995, 79% of MSAs in 2005-2007) than in comparisons between Hispanic/Latino and white PWID (53% of MSAs in 1993-1995, 56% of MSAs in 2005-2007). IARs declined modestly across racial/ethnic groups in most MSAs. CONCLUSIONS: AIDS diagnosis rates continue to be substantially higher for black/African American and Hispanic/Latino PWID than for white PWID in most large MSAs. This finding suggests a need for increased targeting of prevention and treatment programs, as well as research on MSA-level conditions that may serve to maintain the disparities.

AB  - Recent studies demonstrated that a synthetic fusion peptide of HIV-1 self-associates in phospholipid membranes and inhibits HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein-mediated cell fusion, presumably by interacting with the N-terminal domain of gp41 and forming inactive heteroaggregates [Kliger, Y., Aharoni, A., Rapaport, D., Jones, P., Blumenthal, R. & Shai, Y. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 13496-13505]. Here, we show that a synthetic all D-amino acid peptide corresponding to the N-terminal sequence of HIV-1 gp41 (D-WT) of HIV-1 associates with its enantiomeric wild-type fusion (WT) peptide in the membrane and inhibits cell fusion mediated by the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein. D-WT does not inhibit cell fusion mediated by the HIV-2 envelope glycoprotein. WT and D-WT are equally potent in inducing membrane fusion. D-WT peptide but not WT peptide is resistant to proteolytic digestion. Structural analysis showed that the CD spectra of D-WT in trifluoroethanol/water is a mirror image of that of WT, and attenuated total reflectance-fourier transform infrared spectroscopy revealed similar structures and orientation for the two enantiomers in the membrane. The results reveal that the chirality of the synthetic peptide corresponding to the HIV-1 gp41 N-terminal sequence does not play a role in liposome fusion and that the peptides' chirality is not necessarily required for peptide-peptide interaction within the membrane environment. Furthermore, studies along these lines may provide criteria to design protease-resistant therapeutic agents against HIV and other viruses.

AB  - Identifying and linking people to care soon after HIV infection could limit viral transmission and protect their health. This work aims at describing the continuum of care among recently HIV-infected people who inject drugs (PWID) and participated in an intervention in the context of an HIV outbreak in Athens, Greece. The Transmission Reduction Intervention Project (TRIP) conducted risk network-based contact tracing and screened people for recent HIV infection. A comprehensive approach with a case management component that aimed to remove barriers to accessing care was adopted. Follow-up data on antiretroviral treatment (ART) and HIV-RNA levels were obtained from HIV clinics. TRIP enrolled 45 recently HIV-infected PWID (80% male) with a median viral load at recruitment of 5.43 log(10) copies/mL. Of the recently infected persons in TRIP, 87% were linked to care; of these, 77% started ART; and of those on ART, 89% achieved viral load <200 copies/mL. TRIP and its public health allies managed to get most of the recently HIV-infected PWID who were identified by the program into care and many of them onto ART. This resulted in very low HIV-RNA levels. Treatment as prevention can work if individuals are aided in overcoming difficulties in entry to, or attrition from care.

AB  - To study interactions between the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope glycoprotein (gp120-gp41) and the receptor in the target membrane, CD4, a new experimental system utilizing CD4-carrying plasma membrane vesicles (CD4 PMVs) was developed. CD4 PMVs were prepared by hypotonic lysis of HeLa cells expressing CD4 after infection with recombinant vaccinia virus containing the CD4 cDNA. The CD4 PMVs carried up to 680 CD4 molecules per vesicle. Their fusion with cells expressing gp120-gp41 after infection with recombinant vaccinia virus was monitored by fluorescence video microscopy by using lipophilic fluorescent dyes. Fluorescence changes as a result of fusion occurred within 30 min at 37 degrees C, and little fluorescence changes were seen with cells expressing the noncleaved HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (gp160). The preincubation of CD4 PMVs with HIV-1 reduced its infectivity 10-fold. The CD4 PMVs were more effective in inhibiting syncytia formation than sCD4. These results demonstrate that CD4 PMVs could be used to study the mechanisms of HIV-1 envelope-mediated fusion and have the potential to inactivate HIV-1.

AB  - Previously, we showed that the addition of human erythrocyte glycosphingolipids (GSLs) to nonhuman CD4(+) or GSL-depleted human CD4(+) cells rendered those cells susceptible to HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein-mediated cell fusion. Individual components in the GSL mixture were isolated by fractionation on a silica-gel column and incorporated into the membranes of CD4(+) cells. GSL-supplemented target cells were then examined for their ability to fuse with TF228 cells expressing HIV-1LAI envelope glycoprotein. We found that one GSL fraction, fraction 3, exhibited the highest recovery of fusion after incorporation into CD4(+) nonhuman and GSL-depleted HeLa-CD4 cells and that fraction 3 contained a single GSL fraction. Fraction 3 was characterized by MS, NMR spectroscopy, enzymatic analysis, and immunostaining with an antiglobotriaosylceramide (Gb3) antibody and was found to be Gal(alpha1-->4)Gal(beta1-->4)Glc-Cer (Gb3). The addition of fraction 3 or Gb3 to GSL-depleted HeLa-CD4 cells recovered fusion, but the addition of galactosylceramide, glucosylceramide, the monosialoganglioside, GM3, lactosylceramide, globoside, the disialoganglioside, GD3, or alpha-galactosidase A-digested fraction 3 had no effect. Our findings show that the neutral GSL, Gb3, is required for CD4/CXCR4-dependent HIV-1 fusion.

AB  - We have recently shown that addition of human erythrocyte glycosphingolipids (GSL) to non-human CD4+ or GSL-depleted human CD4+ cells rendered those cells susceptible to gp120-gp41-mediated cell fusion (Puri et al., BBRC, 1998). One GSL fraction (Fraction 3) isolated from human erythrocyte GSL mixture exhibited the highest recovery of fusion following incorporation into CD4+ non-human and GSL-depleted HeLa-CD4 cells (HeLa-CD4/GSL-). Structural analysis of Fraction 3 showed that this GSL had identical head group as the known GSL, Gal(alpha1-->4)Gal(beta1-->4)Glc-Ceramide (Gb3) (Puri et al., PNAS, 1998). Here we report that presence of Gb3 in CD4+/CXCR4+ cells but not CD4+/CXCR4 cells allows fusion with HIV-1Lai-envelope glycoprotein expressing cells (TF228). Therefore, Gb3 functions in conjunction with HIV-1 co-receptor, CXCR4 to promote fusion. We propose that Gb3 functions by recruiting CD4 and/or CXCR4 at the fusion site through structurally specific interactions.

AB  - We examined the role of target membrane glycolipids in CD4-mediated HIV-1 fusion by altering the glycolipid levels in CD4+ cells. CD4+ human cells exhibited 50% reduction in extent of fusion with gp120-gp41 expressing cells (TF228) when grown in the presence of a glycolipid synthesis inhibitor PPMP. We added erythrocyte glycolipids (GL) to fusion-incompetent CD4+ non-human cells by influenza-hemagglutinin-mediated fusion between GL-containing liposomes and target cells. Human erythrocyte GL (HuGL)-modified CD4+ non-human cells became susceptible to fusion with TF228 cells. Transfer of bovine erythrocyte glycolipids (BoGL) to CD4+ non-human cells under similar conditions did not complement HIV-1 fusion. Furthermore, addition of HuGL, but not BoGL, to PPMP-inhibited cells rescued fusion to the original levels. Our observations demonstrate that human erythrocyte glycolipids promote CD4-mediated HIV-1 fusion and certain glycolipid(s) from human erythrocytes may serve as alternative and/or additional cofactors in HIV-1 entry.

AB  - It has been shown that human CD4 expressed in nonhuman cells does not support HIV-1 entry into those cells and that components from human cells in addition to CD4 are required to overcome the block. We have used human red blood cells (huRBC) as a source for the accessory components since their membrane composition is less complex than that of nucleated cells and they are well characterized. Components were transferred by fusion of huRBC to nonhuman CD4(+) cells mediated by influenza hemagglutinin or polyethylene glycol. The RBC-modified nonhuman CD4(+) cells were labeled with fluorescent markers and incubated with gp 120-gp41-expressing cells labeled with a different fluorescent probe. Fusion between RBC- modified nonhuman CD4(+) cells and gp 120--gp41-expressing cells was quantified by fluorescence video microscopy. Human erythrocyte components transferred to nonhuman CD4+ cells conferred HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein-mediated fusion susceptibility to those cells. The fusion was enhanced by pretreatment of the erythrocytes for 10 min at 56 degrees. No gp 120--gp41-mediated fusion was observed when components from nonhuman RBC were transferred to nonhuman CD4+ cells. Human cell lines with pre-RBC characteristics (K562-CD4) also supported HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein-mediated fusion.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: HIV-1 uses CD4 and chemokine receptors to enter cells. However, other target membrane components may also be involved. This study examines the role of glycosphingolipids (GSL) in HIV-1 entry into primary lymphocytes and its modulation by an inhibitor of GSL biosynthesis. METHODS: CD4 lymphocytes purified from normal or the p-group subtype individuals that were defective in Gb3 synthesis were treated with a GSL biosynthesis inhibitor, 1-phenyl-2-hexadecanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (PPMP). The PPMP-treated cells were tested for HIV-1 replication by measuring p24 antigen production for 7-14 days post-infection and for susceptibility to HIV-1 Env-mediated fusion monitored by a fluorescent dye transfer assay. The effects of PPMP treatment on HIV-1 binding to CD4 lymphocytes were also examined by measuring HIV-1 p24. RESULTS: CD4 lymphocytes from p donors that are devoid of Gb3, but have elevated levels of GM3 were highly susceptible to HIV-1 fusion/entry. Pre-treatment of primary human CD4 lymphocytes from normal or p-sub-group type with PPMP, significantly reduced HIV-1 replication with no change in CD4 and CXCR4 levels. Inhibition of HIV-1 infection was due to the block in HIV-1 Env-mediated plasma membrane fusion. Binding of HIV-1 to CD4 lymphocytes was not affected by PPMP treatment. CONCLUSION: Manipulation of glycosphingolipid metabolic pathways may alter susceptibility of CD4 lymphocytes to HIV-1 entry.

AB  - We examined the effect of prior influenza virus infection on the susceptibility of CD4+ cells to HIV-1 infection. Influenza virus infection of HeLa-CD4 cells resulted in a marked increase in susceptibility to infection by CXCR4-dependent but not CCR5-dependent HIV isolates. Influenza virus infection resulted in an increase in the steady state level of CXCR4 transcripts and an increase in cell surface CXCR4 expression. Our observations suggest that infectious agents such as influenza may contribute to HIV disease progression by modulating coreceptor availability.

AB  - BACKGROUND: HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) requires continued use at an effective dosage to reduce HIV incidence. Data suggest early PrEP drop-off among many populations. We sought to describe PrEP use over the first year among racial and ethnic minority patients in the US. SETTING: Racial and ethnic minority patients initiating PrEP at a federally qualified health center in Chicago, IL. METHODS: Using electronic health records, we determined the adherence (≥6 weekly doses) trajectories over the first year of PrEP use and compared baseline and time-varying patient characteristics. RESULTS: From 2159 patients, we identified 3 PrEP use trajectories. Sustained use was the most common (40%) trajectory, followed by short use (30%) and declining use (29%). In adjusted models, younger age, Black race, as well as gender, sexual orientation, insurance status at baseline, and neighborhood were associated with trajectory assignment; within some trajectories, insurance status during follow-up was associated with odds of monthly adherence (≥6 weekly doses). CONCLUSION: Among racial and ethnic minorities, a plurality achieved sustained PrEP persistence. Access to clinics, insurance, and intersectional stigmas may be modifiable barriers to effective PrEP persistence; in addition, focus on younger users and beyond gay, cismale populations are needed.

AB  - Purpose of review Since the beginning of the HIV epidemic, social and behavioral scientists have developed interventions to stem the spread of the virus. The dissemination of these interventions has traditionally been a lengthy process; however, implementation science (IS) offers a route toward hastening delivery of effective interventions. A transdisciplinary approach, wherein IS informs and is informed by social and behavioral sciences (SBS) as well as community participation, offers a strategy for more efficiently moving toward health equity and ending the HIV epidemic. Recent findings There has been considerable growth in HIV research utilizing IS theories, methods and frameworks. Many of these studies have been multi or interdisciplinary in nature, demonstrating the ways that IS and SBS can strengthen one another. We also find areas for continued progress toward transdisciplinarity. We review literature from 2020 to 2021, exploring the ways IS and SBS have been used in tandem to develop, evaluate and disseminate HIV interventions. We highlight the interplay between disciplines and make a case for moving toward transdisciplinarity, which would yield new, integrated frameworks that can improve prevention and treatment efforts, moving us closer to achieving health equity.

AB  - This study is among the first to examine the association between multiple domains of HIV-related stigma and health-related correlates including viral load and medication adherence among young Black men who have sex with men (N = 92). Individual logistic regressions were done to examine the hypothesized relationships between HIV-related stigma and various health and psychosocial outcomes. In addition to examining total stigma, we also examined four domains of HIV stigma. Findings revealed the various domains of stigma had differential effects on health-related outcomes. Individuals who reported higher levels of total stigma and personalized stigma were less likely to be virally suppressed (OR 0.96, 95 % CI 0.91-1.00 and OR 0.50, 95 % CI 0.25-1.02, respectively). Concerns about public attitudes toward HIV were positively related to medication adherence (OR 2.18, 95 % CI 1.20-3.94) and psychological distress (OR 5.02, 95 % CI 1.54-16.34). The various domains of HIV stigma differentially affected health and psychosocial outcomes, and our findings suggest that some forms of HIV stigma may significantly affect viral load and medication adherence among this population. Stigma-informed approaches to care and treatment are needed, along with incorporated psychological and social supports.

AB  - In the USA, Black males are disproportionately affected by community violence and HIV. The aim of this study was to assess whether exposures to community violence are related to psychological distress, drug use, sexual risk behaviors, and medication adherence among a sample of HIV-positive young Black men who had sex with men (YBMSM). Data are from 98 YBMSM ages 18-29 years recruited from Chicago who completed measures on demographics, exposures to community violence, psychological distress, drug use, condomless anal intercourse, and medication adherence. Rates of exposure to community violence were high and youth reported victimization and witnessing numerous types of violence in their lifetime. In adjusted logistic regression analyses, models indicate that YBMSM reporting higher levels of exposure to community violence had significantly higher rates of condomless anal intercourse in the previous 6 months (AOR: 5.33, 95%CI: 1.38-20.55). Additionally, exposure to community violence was positively associated with psychological distress, hard drug use, and use of marijuana as a sex drug. Adherence to HIV antiretroviral medication was negatively associated with community violence (AOR: 0.36, 95%CI: 0.13-0.97). Rates of exposure to community violence are especially high in urban communities. Overall findings suggest that treatment, intervention, and programmatic approaches that include initiatives to address exposure to community violence might correlate with better health-related outcomes for HIV-positive YBMSM.

AB  - BackgroundPrevious studies demonstrated a positive association between perceived discrimination and mental health problems among immigrants in countries that traditionally host immigrants. Recent trends in international migration show that there has been a significant increase in immigrant populations in East Asian countries. These newer host countries have different social contexts from traditional ones, yet mental health among these immigrants and its relationship to discrimination are under-researched. Thus, this study aimed to examine the association between perceived discrimination and depressive symptoms among immigrants in one of the newer host countries, South Korea. Moreover, we investigated if differentiated social support (ethnic, host or other support) serves as a moderator of discrimination for depressive symptoms.MethodsThis study used survey data from the 2012 Korean Social Survey on Foreign Residents (N=1068), restricted to adults 20years or older. Multiple linear regression models were conducted to estimate the association between perceived discrimination, social support, and depressive symptoms among immigrants in South Korea.ResultsPerceived discrimination showed a strong positive association with depressive symptoms among immigrants, and ethnic and host support was directly positively associated with depressive symptoms. Furthermore, ethnic support moderated the effects of perceived discrimination on depressive symptoms.ConclusionCommunity-level interventions providing immigrants opportunities to increase social networking members from the same country as well as the native-born in a host country may be helpful resources for improving mental health among immigrants in South Korea. Also, raising awareness of racial discrimination among members in South Korea would be crucial.

AB  - The fusion of HIV and SIV with biological membranes was studied by photosensitized activation of a hydrophobic probe, [(125)I]iodonaphthylazide ([(125)I]INA), by a fluorescent lipid which is situated in the target membrane. Photosensitized labeling of viral envelope-resident proteins occurs only upon their insertion into target membranes. Photosensitized labeling as a result of HIV-1 Env-mediated cell fusion showed the same kinetics as aqueous dye transfer. We have for the first time measured kinetics of HIV and SIV virus-cell fusion. HIV-1(MN) virions were about 10x less fusion active than SIVmne virions. SIV inactivated by aldrithiol-2 retained fusion activity similar to that seen with untreated virus. The relatively slow time course of SIV-cell fusion (t(1/2) = 19 min) indicates that the fusion events are stochastic. This feature provides a basis for understanding the mode of action of HIV/SIV entry inhibitors that target transition states.

AB  - We describe a new approach for the preparation of inactivated retroviruses for vaccine application. The lipid domain of the viral envelope was selectively targeted to inactivate proteins and lipids therein and block fusion of the virus with the target cell membrane. In this way, complete elimination of the infectivity of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) could be achieved with preservation of antigenic determinants on the surface of the viral envelope. Inactivation was accomplished by modification of proteins and lipids in the viral envelope using the hydrophobic photoinduced alkylating probe 1,5 iodonaphthylazide (INA). Treatment of HIV and SIV isolates with INA plus light completely blocked fusion of the viral envelope and abolished infectivity. The inactivated virus remained structurally unchanged, with no detectable loss of viral proteins. Modifications to envelope and nucleocapsid proteins were detected by changes in their elution pattern on reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. These modifications had no effect on primary and secondary structure epitopes as determined by monoclonal antibodies. Likewise, the inactivated HIV reacted as well as the live virus with the conformation-sensitive and broadly neutralizing anti-HIV type 1 monoclonal antibodies 2G12, b12, and 4E10. Targeting the lipid domain of biological membranes with hydrophobic alkylating compounds could be used as a general approach for inactivation of enveloped viruses and other pathogenic microorganisms for vaccine application.

AB  - We had previously reported that glycosphingolipids (GSL) support human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) entry. In this study, we further examined this issue by expressing HIV-1 receptors in GSL-deficient GM95 cells. GM95 cells expressing low levels of CD4 and CXCR4 or CCR5 did not support HIV-1 Env-mediated fusion. However, higher expression of these receptors rendered GM95 cells highly susceptible to fusion with cells expressing appropriate HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins (HIV-1 Envs). The GM95 cells exhibited a different fusion phenotype when compared with GSL(+) NIH3T3 cells bearing similar receptor levels. Fusion of GM95 targets expressing higher levels of CD4 and coreceptors occurred at 25 degrees C and was sensitive to cholesterol depletion or disruption of the cytoskeleton. In contrast, the fusion threshold of NIH3T3CD4X4/R5 targets was at >/=28 degrees C as previously reported and was insensitive to cholesterol depletion or cytoskeletal network disruption. On the basis of these observations, we propose that target membrane GSLs support HIV-1 Env-mediated fusion at low density of receptors by stabilizing receptor pools in natural targets.

AB  - GM3, a major ganglioside of T lymphocytes, promotes human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) entry via interactions with HIV-1 receptors and the viral envelope glycoprotein (Env). Increased GM3 levels in T lymphocytes and the appearance of anti-GM3 antibodies in AIDS patients have been reported earlier. In this study, we investigated the effect of GM3 regulation on HIV-1 entry by utilizing a mouse cell line (B16F10), which expresses exceptionally high levels of GM3. Strikingly, B16 cells bearing CD4, CXCR4, and/or CCR5 were highly resistant to CD4-dependent HIV-1 Env-mediated membrane fusion. In contrast, these targets supported membrane fusion mediated by CD4-requiring HIV-2, SIV, and CD4-independent HIV-1 Envs. Coreceptor function was not impaired by GM3 overexpression as indicated by Ca(2+) fluxes mediated by the CXCR4 ligand SDF-1alpha and the CCR5 ligand MIP-1beta. Reduction in GM3 levels of B16 target cells resulted in a significant recovery of CD4-dependent HIV-1 Env-mediated fusion. We propose that GM3 in the plasma membrane blocks HIV-1 Env-mediated fusion by interfering with the lateral association of HIV-1 receptors. Our findings offer a novel mechanism of interplay between membrane lipids and receptors by which host cells may escape viral infections.

AB  - Our previous studies show that the depletion of cholesterol or sphingolipids (raft-associated lipids) from receptor-bearing adherent cell lines blocks HIV-1 entry and HIV-1 Env-mediated membrane fusion. Here we have evaluated the mechanism(s) by which these lipids contribute to the HIV-1 Env-mediated membrane fusion. We report the following: (1) GSL depletion from a suspension T lymphocyte cell line (Sup-T1) reduced subsequent fusion with HIV-1IIIB-expressing cells by 70%. (2) Cholesterol depletion from NIH3T3 cells bearing HIV-1 receptors (NIH3T3CD4R5/NIH3T3CD4X4) did not impair subsequent fusion with HeLa cells expressing the corresponding HIV-1 Envs. In contrast GSL depletion from these targets reduced fusion by 50% suggesting that GSL facilitate fusion in different ways. (3) GSL-deficient GM95 cells bearing high receptors fused with HIV-1 Env-expressing cells at 37 degrees C with kinetics similar to that of GSL + NIH3T3 targets. Based on these observations, we propose that the plasma membrane cholesterol is required to maintain the integrity of receptor pools whereas GSLs are involved in stabilizing the coupling of inter-receptor pools.

AB  - We investigated the effect of receptor mobility on HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env)-triggered fusion using B16 mouse melanoma cells that are engineered to express CD4 and CXCR4 or CCR5. These engineered cells are resistant to fusion mediated CD4-dependent HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein. Receptor mobility was measured by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) using either fluorescently-labeled antibodies or transient expression of GFP-tagged receptors in the cells. No significant differences between B16 and NIH3T3 (fusion-permissive) cells were seen in lateral mobility of CCR5 or lipid probes. By contrast CD4 mobility in B16 cells was about seven-fold reduced compared to its mobility in fusion-permissive NIH3T3 cells. However, a CD4 mutant (RA5) that localizes to non-raft membrane microdomains exhibited a three-fold increased mobility in B16 cells as compared with WT-CD4. Interestingly, the B16 cells expressing the RA5 mutant (but not the wild type CD4) and coreceptors supported HIV-1 Env-mediated fusion. Our data demonstrate that the lateral mobility of CD4 is an important determinant of HIV-1 fusion/entry.

AB  - A central question in the pathogenesis of HIV-associated thrombotic microangiopathic (HIV-TMA) lesions is whether the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (HIV-1 Env) can interact directly with human glomerular endothelial cells (HGECs) through specific HIV-1 co-receptors. The goal of this study was to determine whether cultured primary HGECs express significant levels of the major HIV-1 co-receptors CD4, CXCR4, and/or CCR5 to allow fusion interactions with HIV-1. The expression of CD4, CXCR-4 and CCR-5 was assessed in cultured HGECs by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and flow cytometry using specific antibodies. The HIV-1 Env-mediated membrane fusion of target glomerular cells was evaluated by a fluorescent dye transfer-based cell-cell fusion microscopic method. HGECs express CXCR4 mRNA and protein as determined by RT-PCR and immunostaining with phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-CXCR4 Mab 12G5. CD4 and CCR5 were not detected in HGECs, either by RT-PCR or by surface immunostaining with specific antibodies. Incubation of HGECs with cells expressing a CD4-independent envelope strain (HIV-1IIIB-8x) and the CD4-dependent envelope strain (HIV-1IIIB) resulted in transfer of fluorescent dyes of approximately 20% after 8-16 h incubation at 37 degrees C. Incubation in the presence of inhibitors (C34, which blocks six-helix bundle formation, and AMD3100, which interacts with CXCR4) reduced dye transfer by 60%-80%, confirming that the dye transfer was specific with respect to gp120-gp41-mediated fusion. Cultured primary HGECs express CXCR4 but not CD4 or CCR5. The ability of HGECs to promote fusion by a CD4-independent HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein suggests that these cells may become a potential direct target of certain HIV-1 isolates.

AB  - HIV entry inhibitors include coreceptor antagonists and the fusion inhibitor T-20. T-20 binds the first helical region (HR1) in the gp41 subunit of the viral envelope (Env) protein and prevents conformational changes required for membrane fusion. HR1 appears to become accessible to T-20 after Env binds CD4, whereas coreceptor binding is thought to induce the final conformational changes that lead to membrane fusion. Thus, T-20 binds to a structural intermediate of the fusion process. Primary viruses exhibit considerable variability in T-20 sensitivity, and determinants outside of HR1 can affect sensitivity by unknown mechanisms. We studied chimeric Env proteins containing different V3 loop sequences and found that gp120coreceptor affinity correlated with T-20 and coreceptor antagonist sensitivity, with greater affinity resulting in increased resistance to both classes of entry inhibitors. Enhanced affinity resulted in more rapid fusion kinetics, reducing the time during which Env is sensitive to T-20. Reduced coreceptor expression levels also delayed fusion kinetics and enhanced virus sensitivity to T-20, whereas increased coreceptor levels had the opposite effect. A single amino acid change (K421D) in the bridging sheet region of the primary virus strain YU2 reduced affinity for CCR5 and increased T-20 sensitivity by about 30-fold. Thus, mutations in Env that affect receptor engagement and membrane fusion rates can alter entry inhibitor sensitivity. Because coreceptor expression levels are typically limiting in vivo, individuals who express lower coreceptor levels may respond more favorably to entry inhibitors such as T-20, whose effectiveness we show depends in part on fusion kinetics.

AB  - Human apolipoprotein-B mRNA-editing catalytic polypeptide-like 3G (A3G) is a cytidine deaminase that restricts retroviruses, endogenous retro-elements and DNA viruses. A3G plays a key role in the anti-HIV-1 innate cellular immunity. The HIV-1 Vif protein counteracts A3G mainly by leading A3G towards the proteosomal machinery and by direct inhibition of its enzymatic activity. Both activities involve direct interaction between Vif and A3G. Disrupting the interaction between A3G and Vif may rescue A3G antiviral activity and inhibit HIV-1 propagation. Here, mapping the interaction sites between A3G and Vif by peptide array screening revealed distinct regions in Vif important for A3G binding, including the N-terminal domain (NTD), C-terminal domain (CTD) and residues 83-99. The Vif-binding sites in A3G included 12 different peptides that showed strong binding to either full-length Vif, Vif CTD or both. Sequence similarity was found between Vif-binding peptides from the A3G CTD and NTD. A3G peptides were synthesized and tested for their ability to counteract Vif action. A3G 211-225 inhibited HIV-1 replication in cell culture and impaired Vif dependent A3G degradation. In vivo co-localization of full-length Vif with A3G 211-225 was demonstrated by use of FRET. This peptide has the potential to serve as an anti-HIV-1 lead compound. Our results suggest a complex interaction between Vif and A3G that is mediated by discontinuous binding regions with different affinities.

AB  - Fusion of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) with target cells is mediated by the gp41 subunit of the envelope protein. Mutation and deletion studies within the transmembrane domain (TMD) of intact gp41 influenced its fusion activity. In addition, current models suggest that the TMD is in proximity with the fusion peptide (FP) at the late fusion stages, but there are no direct experimental data to support this hypothesis. Here, we investigated the TMD focusing on two regions: the N-terminal containing the GxxxG motif and the C-terminal containing the GLRI motif, which is conserved among the TMDs of HIV and the T-cell receptor. Studies utilizing the ToxR expression system combined with synthetic peptides and their fluorescent analogues derived from TMD revealed that the GxxxG motif is important for TMD self-association, whereas the C-terminal region is for its heteroassociation with FP. Functionally, all three TMD peptides induced lipid mixing that was enhanced significantly upon mixing with FP. Furthermore, the TMD peptides inhibited virus-cell fusion apparently through their interaction with their endogenous counterparts. Notably, the R2E mutant (in the GLRI) was significantly less potent than the two others. Overall, our findings provide experimental evidence that HIV-1 TMD contributes to membrane assembly and function of the HIV-1 envelope. Owing to similarities between functional domains within viruses, these findings suggest that the TMDs and FPs may contribute similarly in other viruses as well.

AB  - There is increasing appreciation of the need to understand how social and structural factors shape HIV risk. Drawing on a review of recently published literature, we seek to describe the social structural production of HIV risk associated with injecting drug use. We adopt an inclusive definition of the HIV 'risk environment' as the space, whether social or physical, in which a variety of factors exogenous to the individual interact to increase vulnerability to HIV. We identify the following factors as critical in the social structural production of HIV risk associated with drug injecting: cross-border trade and transport links; population movement and mixing; urban or neighbourhood deprivation and disadvantage; specific injecting environments (including shooting galleries and prisons); the role of peer groups and social networks; the relevance of 'social capital' at the level of networks, communities and neighbourhoods; the role of macro-social change and political or economic transition; political, social and economic inequities in relation to ethnicity, gender and sexuality; the role of social stigma and discrimination in reproducing inequity and vulnerability; the role of policies, laws and policing; and the role of complex emergencies such as armed conflict and natural disasters. We argue that the HIV risk environment is a product of interplay in which social and structural factors intermingle but where political-economic factors may play a predominant role. We therefore emphasise that much of the most needed 'structural HIV prevention' is unavoidably political in that it calls for community actions and structural changes within a broad framework concerned to alleviate inequity in health, welfare and human rights.

AB  - Injection drug use continues to place women at risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) through both risky injecting practices and risky sexual behavior with male injection drug users (IDUs). Although attendance at syringe-exchange programs (SEPs) is protective against HIV, a recent study found that women attending SEPs who exchanged syringes for other people (secondary exchange) were at greater risk for HIV seroconversion, potentially through risky sexual behavior. We examined this question in a sample of 531 IDUs (175 women and 356 men) attending 23 SEPs in California in 2001. Findings indicated that women were more likely than men to engage in secondary exchange and were more likely to have IDU sexual partners. In multivariate analysis among women, secondary exchange was independently associated with distributive syringe sharing, not engaging in receptive sharing, and not exchanging sex for money or drugs. Multivariate analysis among men found that having an IDU sexual partner was associated with secondary exchange. Women's sexual risk behavior was not associated with secondary exchange, and although women's secondary exchange was associated with individual protection for injection-related behaviors, it may increase network risk. More information on network members is needed to understand gender differences in secondary exchange.

AB  - Increased options for syringe acquisition and disposal have been associated with reductions in high-risk behaviors. This study determined the extent of pharmacy uptake in accessing syringes among injection drug users (IDUs) and estimated associations between pharmacy uptake and safer injection/disposal practices. Two years after the implementation of California's Disease Prevention Demonstration Project, which removed restrictions to non-prescription syringe sales through pharmacies with local authorization, IDUs were recruited through street outreach in San Francisco and interviewed regarding recent syringe acquisition, use, and disposal. The sample of 105 persons included a high proportion of men (67%), people of color (49%), and homeless persons (71%). The most common syringe source was a syringe exchange program (SEP) (80%), with pharmacies being accessed by 39% of respondents. The most commonly cited source of disposal was a SEP (65%), with very few reports of pharmacy disposal (2%). Adjusted analysis showed that unsuccessful attempts to purchase syringes at a pharmacy increased the odds of both injecting with a used syringe and giving away a used syringe. Using a SEP decreased the odds of unsafe injection and disposal practices. Thus, 2 years after the initiation of the California Disease Prevention Demonstration Project, results from this small study suggest that SEPs still provide the majority of syringe distribution and disposal services to San Francisco IDUs; however, pharmacies now augment syringe access. In addition, unsafe injection behavior is reported more often among those who do not use these syringe sources. These results are consistent with prior studies in suggesting that increasing the availability of syringes through SEPs and pharmacies, and developing bridges between them, may further reduce syringe-related risk.

AB  - City-specific studies have suggested the quality of the local environment and economic circumstances are associated with greater risk of injection drug use (IDU). No studies have assessed the relation among the quality of the local environment, economic circumstances, and IDU over time across US metropolitan areas. Annual numbers of IDUs in the 88 largest US metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) were estimated by extrapolating, adjusting, and allocating existing estimates using various data sources. Generalized estimating equations were used to assess the relation among the quality of the local environment, metropolitan political economy, and IDU prevalence using lagged models taking into account potential confounders. MSAs with a worse local environment (measured as a one standard deviation difference) had a greater risk of IDU (relative risk [RR]=1.03, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01, 1.06); similarly, a one-percentage point worsening of the political economy for an MSA was associated with greater risk of IDU (RR=1.04-1.10). Final models stratified by region indicated heterogeneity of effect by region whereby the quality of the local environment was associated with IDU strongest in the South (RR=1.12, CI: 1.05, 1.12) followed by the West (RR=1.04, CI: 1.01, 1.07) and Midwest (RR=1.03, CI: 1.00, 1.06), and the metropolitan political economy was associated with IDU in the West (RR=1.03-1.09) and Northeast (RR=1.04-1.12). Our results underscore the importance of sociopolitical factors as determinants of IDU in MSAs. Structural solutions targeted at improving environmental conditions and economic circumstances should be considered as drug use interventions.

AB  - The New York City injection drug user acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (IDU AIDS) epidemic accounts for almost one quarter of AIDS cases in IDUs in the United States. Recent studies have reported declines in seroprevalence and risk behaviors among IDUs in New York City during the 1990s. These trends, however, are based on studies primarily conducted in the city's central borough of Manhattan. This article analyzes data from all five boroughs of New York City to examine trends over phases of the epidemic and to determine the level of prevention services available; an exploratory qualitative study was also conducted to assess access to prevention services and injection practices in areas in the "outer boroughs." Findings indicated that (1) borough differences in services and behaviors existed from early in the epidemic; (2) services have been concentrated in Manhattan; and (3) declines in seroprevalence were greatest among Manhattan-recruited IDUs. Enhancing access to services for IDUs in the boroughs outside Manhattan may be needed to continue the positive trends in all areas of New York City.

AB  - The objective of the research was to assess the effects of geographic proximity on the utilization of syringe exchange among injection drug users (IDUs) in New York City. Between 1994 and 1996, 805 IDUs were interviewed with a structured questionnaire. Geographic proximity was defined as living within a ten-minute walk. Eighty-one per cent of IDUs who lived close typically used a syringe exchange compared to 59% of those who lived further away. In multiple logistic regression analysis, those who lived close remained (adjusted odds ratio of 2.89; 95% CI 2.06 to 4.06, p = 0.001) more likely to use syringe exchange. Those who lived close were less likely to have engaged in receptive syringe sharing at last injection (adjusted odds ratio = 0.45, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.86, p = 0.015). In conclusion, locating exchange services in areas convenient to large numbers of IDUs may be critical for prevention of HIV infection.

AB  - In this oral history, 23 injection drug users (IDUs) were interviewed about the mid-1970s to mid-1980s when they could not legally purchase or possess syringes, and the threat of AIDS began to loom large. Several themes emerged, including: abrupt changes in syringe-sharing patterns; the effects of illnesses or deaths of others on their understanding of AIDS; and, racial/ethnic differences in responses to the threat of AIDS. Settings, such as "shooting galleries," helped HIV spread rapidly in the earliest stages of the city's AIDS epidemic. HIV entered the drug scene in the mid-1970s, just when IDUs were shifting from sharing homemade "works" (consisting of steel needles and syringes devised from rubber baby pacifiers and similar sources) among many IDUs to mass produced and distributed plastic, disposable needle and syringe sets. IDUs remember when they first became aware of AIDS and began to adjust their behaviors and social assumptions.

AB  - Specific glycosphingolipids (GSL), found on the surface of target immune cells, are recognized as alternate cell surface receptors by the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) external envelope glycoprotein. In this study, the globotriose and 3'-sialyllactose carbohydrate head groups found on two GSL were covalently attached to a dendrimer core to produce two types of unique multivalent carbohydrates (MVC). These MVC inhibited HIV-1 infection of T cell lines and primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) by T cell line-adapted viruses or primary isolates, with IC(50)s ranging from 0.1 to 7.4 μg/ml. Inhibition of Env-mediated membrane fusion by MVC was also observed using a dye-transfer assay. These carbohydrate compounds warrant further investigation as a potential new class of HIV-1 entry inhibitors. The data presented also shed light on the role of carbohydrate moieties in HIV-1 virus-host cell interactions.

AB  - The aim of this study was to estimate the seroprevalence rates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV, core antibody), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and syphilis infections and analyze associated risk factors among 504 non-injecting cocaine users (NICU) in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Participants were interviewed in face-to-face sessions through a short structured questionnaire. Using venipuncture, 10 mL of blood was collected. Seroprevalence rates were: HIV (6.3%), HBV (9%), HCV (7.5%), and VDRL (4.2%). The risk of being infected with HIV, HBV, and HCV was significantly associated with having had a sex partner who was either a drug injector or who was known to be HIV positive. HIV and HCV infections were associated with former imprisonment, and HCV was associated with having been tattooed. Because of the rising number of NICU and the multiple infections detected, it is essential to implement prevention strategies focused on this population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In some countries, "Big Events" like crises and transitions have been followed by large increases in drug use, drug injection and HIV/AIDS. Argentina experienced an economic crisis and political transition in 2001/2002 that affected how people use their time. This paper studies how time use changes between years 2001 and 2004, subsequent to these events, were associated with drug consumption in poor neighbourhoods of Greater Buenos Aires. METHODS: In 2003-2004, 68 current injecting drug users (IDUs) and 235 young non-IDUs, aged 21-35, who lived in impoverished drug-impacted neighbourhoods in Greater Buenos Aires, were asked about time use then and in 2001. Data on weekly hours spent working or looking for work, doing housework/childcare, consuming drugs, being with friends, and hanging out in the neighbourhood, were studied in relation to time spent using drugs. Field observations and focus groups were also conducted. RESULTS: After 2001, among both IDUs and non-IDUs, mean weekly time spent working declined significantly (especially among IDUs); time spent looking for work increased, and time spent with friends and hanging out in the neighbourhood decreased.We found no increase in injecting or non-injecting drug consumption after 2001. Subjects most affected by the way the crises led to decreased work time and/or to increased time looking for work--and by the associated increase in time spent in one's neighbourhood--were most likely to increase their time using drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Time use methods are useful to study changes in drug use and their relationships to every day life activities. In these previously-drug-impacted neighbourhoods, the Argentinean crisis did not lead to an increase in drug use, which somewhat contradicts our initial expectations. Nevertheless, those for whom the crises led to decreased work time, increased time looking for work, and increased time spent in indoor or outdoor neighbourhood environments, were likely to spend more time using drugs. These data suggest that young adults in traditionally less-impoverished neighbourhoods may be more vulnerable to Big Events than those in previously drug-impacted impoverished neighbourhoods. Since Big Events will continue to occur, research on the pathways that determine their sequelae is needed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Among persons who inject drugs (PWID), polydrug use (the practice of mixing multiple drugs/alcohol sequentially or simultaneously) increases risk for HIV transmission and unintentional overdose deaths. Research has shown local drug markets influence drug use practices. However, little is known about the impact of drug mixing in markets dominated by black tar heroin and methamphetamine, such as the western United States. METHODS: Data were collected through an ongoing longitudinal study examining drug use, risk behavior, and health status among PWID. Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify patterns of substance use (heroin, methamphetamine, prescription drugs, alcohol, and marijuana) via multiple administration routes (injecting, smoking, and swallowing). Logistic regression was used to identify behaviors and health indicators associated with drug use class. RESULTS: The sample included 511 mostly white (51.5%) males (73.8%), with mean age of 43.5 years. Two distinct classes of drug users predominated: methamphetamine by multiple routes (51%) and heroin by injection (49%). In multivariable logistic regression, class membership was associated with age, race, and housing status. PWID who were HIV-seropositive and reported prior sexually transmitted infections had increased odds of belonging to the methamphetamine class. Those who were HCV positive and reported previous opioid overdose had an increased odds of being in the primarily heroin injection class (all P-values < .05). CONCLUSION: Risk behaviors and health outcomes differed between PWID who primarily inject heroin vs. those who use methamphetamine. The findings suggest that in a region where PWID mainly use black tar heroin or methamphetamine, interventions tailored to sub-populations of PWID could improve effectiveness.

AB  - Trust is an important factor, particularly in viral/social advertising, and computing trust scores for individual users of a social network is crucial for several applications in the advertising research and practice. However, research on trust in the advertising field has been limited, and the application of computational trust to advertising research using big data is rare. Addressing the gap in the research literature, this study proposed and empirically tested a new social media analytics method, the Trust Scores in Social Media (TSM) algorithm, for measuring individual users' trust levels in a social network. TSM proposes the concept of negatively reinforced trust scores and introduces two complementary measures of trust, trustingness, and trustworthiness. Another unique and important element in the TSM algorithm is the incorporation of trust-decision involvement to adjust trust scores depending on the level of trust-decision involvement of different networks. Using small survey data and big data from social networks, this study demonstrated the effectiveness of the TSM algorithm. Various applications of the TSM algorithm to viral/social advertising research and practice are also discussed.

AB  - The increase in analysis of real life social networks has led to a better understanding of the ways humans socialize in a group. Since trust is an important part of any social interaction, researchers use such networks to understand the nuances of trust relationships. One of the major requirements in trust applications is identifying the trustworthy actors in these networks. This paper proposes a pair of complementary measures that can be used to measure trust scores of actors in a social network using involvement of social networks. Based on the proposed measures, an iterative matrix convergence algorithm is developed that calculates the trustingness and the trustworthiness of each actor in the network. Trustingness of an actor is defined as the propensity of an actor to trust his neighbors in the network. Trustworthiness, on the other hand, is defined as the willingness of the network to trust an individual actor. The algorithm is proposed based on the idea that a person having higher trustingness score contributes to the trustworthiness of its neighbors to a lower degree. Conversely, a higher trustworthiness score is a result of lots of neighbors linked to the actor having low trustingness scores. The algorithm runs in O (k x vertical bar E vertical bar) time where k denotes the number of iterations and vertical bar E vertical bar denotes the number of edges in the network. Moreover, the paper shows that the algorithm converges to a finite value quickly. Finally the proposed scores for trust prediction is implemented for various social networks and is shown that the proposed algorithm performs better (average 5 %) than the state of the art trust scoring algorithms. The full version of the paper along with the coding implementation can be found at [3].

AB  - Pediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI) results in heightened risk for social deficits that can emerge during adolescence and adulthood. A moderate TBI in male and female rats on postnatal day 11 (equivalent to children below the age of 4) resulted in impairments in social novelty recognition, defined as the preference for interacting with a novel rat compared with a familiar rat, but not sociability, defined as the preference for interacting with a rat compared with an object in the three-chamber test when tested at four weeks (adolescence) and eight weeks (adulthood) postinjury. The deficits in social recognition were not accompanied by deficits in novel object recognition memory and were associated with a decrease in the frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) recorded from pyramidal neurons within Layer II/III of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Whereas TBI did not affect the expression of oxytocin (OXT) or the OXT receptor (OXTR) mRNAs in the hypothalamus and mPFC, respectively, intranasal administration of OXT before behavioral testing was found to reduce impairments in social novelty recognition and increase IPSC frequency in the mPFC in brain-injured animals. These results suggest that TBI-induced deficits in social behavior may be linked to increased excitability of neurons in the mPFC and suggests that the regulation of GABAergic neurotransmission in this region as a potential mechanism underlying these deficits.

AB  - Street-connected young people (SCYP) in the Republic of Georgia are vulnerable to HIV/AIDS. We conducted a mixed-methods study utilizing a triangulation design with N=20 SCYP aged 11-18 (50% female; M = 13.95 years; SD = 2.11) recruited from two cities in Georgia. SCYP completed a close-ended survey and an in-depth interview on their perceptions of romantic and exchange sex relationships. Quantitative analyses examined gender differences in perceptions of romantic and exchange sex partners, and qualitative data was analyzed using a thematic analysis approach. Quantitative findings indicated that a higher proportion of female than male SCYP endorsed engaging in HIV-related transmission behaviors with exchange sex partners. Thematic analysis contextualized survey findings by elucidating the ways in which females negotiated a highly gendered risk environment that elevated their vulnerability to HIV. Study results highlight the need for gender-responsive programming to address the HIV prevention needs of both male and female SCYP in the Republic of Georgia.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Statins remain a mainstay in the prevention and treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). OBJECTIVE: To detail the trends in use and total and out-of-pocket (OOP) expenditures associated with statins in a representative US adult population from 2002 to 2013. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective longitudinal cohort study was conducted from January 2002 to December 2013. Demographic, medical condition, and prescribed medicine information of adults 40 years and older between 2002 and 2013 were obtained from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey database. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Estimated trends in statin use, total expenditure, and OOP share among the general adult population, those with established ASCVD, and those at risk for ASCVD. Costs were adjusted to 2013 US dollars using the Gross Domestic Product Index. RESULTS: From 2002 to 2013, more than 157 000 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey participants were eligible for the study (mean [SD] age, 57.7 [39.9] years; 52.1% female). Overall, statin use among US adults 40 years of age and older in the general population increased 79.8% from 21.8 million individuals (17.9%) in 2002-2003 (134 million prescriptions) to 39.2 million individuals (27.8%) in 2012-2013 (221 million prescriptions). Among those with established ASCVD, statin use was 49.8% and 58.1% in 2002-2003 and 2012-2013, respectively, and less than one-third were prescribed as a high-intensity dose. Across all subgroups, statin use was significantly lower in women (odds ratio, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.79-0.85), racial/ethnic minorities (odds ratio, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.61-0.70), and the uninsured (odds ratio, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.30-0.37). The proportion of generic statin use increased substantially, from 8.4% in 2002-2003 to 81.8% in 2012-2013. Gross domestic product-adjusted total cost for statins decreased from $17.2 billion (OOP cost, $7.6 billion) in 2002-2003 to $16.9 billion (OOP cost, $3.9 billion) in 2012-2013, and the mean annual OOP costs for patients decreased from $348 to $94. Brand-name statins were used by 18.2% of statin users, accounting for 55% of total costs in 2012-2013. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Statin use increased substantially in the last decade among US adults, although the uptake was suboptimal in high-risk groups. While total and OOP expenditures associated with statins decreased, further substitution of brand-name to generic statins may yield more savings.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence supporting nonstatin lipid-lowering therapy in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk reduction is variable. We aim to examine nonstatin utilization and expenditures in the United States between 2002 and 2013. METHODS AND RESULTS: We used the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey database to estimate national trends in nonstatin use and cost (total and out-of-pocket, adjusted to 2013 US dollars using a gross domestic product deflator) among adults 40 years or older. Nonstatin users increased from 3 million (2.5%) in 2002-2003 (20.1 million prescriptions) to 8 million (5.6%) in 2012-2013 (45.8 million prescriptions). Among adults with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, nonstatin use increased from 7.5% in 2002-2003 to 13.9% in 2012-2013 after peaking at 20.3% in 2006-2007. In 2012-2013, 15.9% of high-intensity statin users also used nonstatins, versus 9.7% of low/moderate-intensity users and 3.6% of statin nonusers. Nonstatin use was significantly lower among women (odds ratio 0.80; 95% confidence interval 0.75-0.86), racial/ethnic minorities (odds ratio 0.41; 95% confidence interval 0.36-0.47), and the uninsured (odds ratio 0.47; 95% confidence interval 0.40-0.56). Total nonstatin expenditures increased from $1.7 billion (out-of-pocket cost, $0.7 billion) in 2002-2003 to $7.9 billion (out-of-pocket cost $1.6 billion) in 2012-2013, as per-user nonstatin expenditure increased from $550 to $992. Nonstatin expenditure as a proportion of all lipid-lowering therapy expenditure increased 4-fold from 8% to 32%. CONCLUSIONS: Between 2002 and 2013, nonstatin use increased by 124%, resulting in a 364% increase in nonstatin-associated expenditures.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We estimated prevalence and identified correlates of crack-cocaine injection among young injection drug users in the United States. METHODS: We analyzed data from the second Collaborative Injection Drug Users Study (CIDUS II), a 1997-1999 cohort study of 18-30-year-old, street-recruited injection drug users from six US cities. RESULTS: Crack-cocaine injection was reported by 329 (15%) of 2198 participants. Prevalence varied considerably by site (range, 1.5-28.0%). No participants injected only crack-cocaine. At four sites where crack-cocaine injection prevalence was greater than 10%, recent (past 6 months) crack-cocaine injection was correlated with recent daily injection and sharing of syringes, equipment, and drug solution. Lifetime crack-cocaine injection was correlated with using shooting galleries, initiating others into drug injection, and having serologic evidence of hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus infection. CONCLUSIONS: Crack-cocaine injection may be a marker for high-risk behaviors that can be used to direct efforts to prevent HIV and other blood-borne viral infections.

AB  - In this work we demonstrate that blood glucose can be controlled remotely through light stimulated release of insulin from an injected cutaneous depot. Human insulin was tethered to an insoluble but injectable polymer via a linker, which was based on the light cleavable di-methoxy nitrophenyl ethyl (DMNPE) group. This material was injected into the skin of streptozotocin-treated diabetic rats. We observed insulin being released into the bloodstream after a 2 min trans-cutaneous irradiation of this site by a compact LED light source. Control animals treated with the same material, but in which light was blocked from the site, showed no release of insulin into the bloodstream. We also demonstrate that additional pulses of light from the light source result in additional pulses of insulin being absorbed into circulation. A significant reduction in blood glucose was then observed. Together, these results demonstrate the feasibility of using light to allow for the continuously variable control of insulin release. This in turn has the potential to allow for the tight control of blood glucose without the invasiveness of insulin pumps and cannulas.

AB  - Apoptotic deletion of expanded B cell populations is essential in avoidance of autoimmune disease and immune regulation of some B cell malignancies. The role of CD4+ T cells in B cell apoptosis is evident from the high incidence of B cell tumors and autoimmunity in patients with T cell diseases such as the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). We have previously demonstrated that in Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) negative Burkitt's lymphoma (BL), a tumor derived from proliferating centroblasts of the germinal center, the malignant lymphocytes can be induced to express Fas (CD95) by ligation of CD40 at the B cell surface. Upon CD40 engagement, BL cells are sensitized to T-cell derived death signals provided by Fas ligand (FasL, CD95L). HBL-3 is a cell line derived from an AIDS-related BL in which the tumor IgM binds the human erythrocyte "i" antigen. To determine whether Fas-mediated apoptosis of BL cells is reduced in the context of antigen to which the tumor IgM binds, we stimulated HBL-3 cells with CD40 ligand (CD40L, CD 154) in the presence and absence of human erythrocytes expressing the "i" antigen, and measured Fas-mediated apoptosis upon exposure to an agonistic anti-Fas antibody. We observed that HBL-3 cells were sensitized to Fas-mediated death by exposure to CD40L. When i+ RBCs were present, Fas-mediated apoptosis in HBL-3 cells was reduced by greater than 30%. In contrast, there was no reduction in Fas-mediated apoptosis in the presence of i- (I+) RBCs. These findings demonstrate that Fas-mediated deletion of BL cells is inhibited upon surface IgM engagement by antigen for which the malignant clone has affinity.

AB  - Critical to the development of improved HIV elimination efforts is a greater understanding of how social networks and their dynamics are related to HIV risk and prevention. In this paper, we examine network stability of confidant and sexual networks among young black men who have sex with men (YBMSM). We use data from uConnect (2013-2016), a population-based, longitudinal cohort study. We use an innovative approach to measure both sexual and confidant network stability at three time points, and examine the relationship between each type of stability and HIV risk and prevention behaviors. This approach is consistent with a co-evolutionary perspective in which behavior is not only affected by static properties of an individual's network, but may also be associated with changes in the topology of his or her egocentric network. Our results indicate that although confidant and sexual network stability are moderately correlated, their dynamics are distinct with different predictors and differing associations with behavior. Both types of stability are associated with lower rates of risk behaviors, and both are reduced among those who have spent time in jail. Public health awareness and engagement with both types of networks may provide new opportunities for HIV prevention interventions.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Black men who have sex with men (BMSM) have the highest rates of HIV in the United States. Despite increased attention to social and sexual networks as a framework for biomedical intervention, the role of family in these networks and their relationship to HIV prevention have received limited attention. METHODS: A network sample (N = 380) of BMSM (n = 204) and their family members (n = 176) was generated through respondent-driven sampling of BMSM and elicitation of their personal networks. The proportion of personal network members who were family was calculated, and the weighted logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between this proportion and unprotected anal intercourse, sex-drug use (SDU), and group sex (GS), as well as intravention efforts to discourage these risk behaviors among their MSM social networks. RESULTS: 45.3% of respondents listed at least 1 family member in their close personal network. Greater family network proportion (having 2 or more family members in the close network) was associated with less SDU [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 0.38, 95% CI: 0.17 to 0.87] and participation in GS (AOR 0.25, 95% CI: 0.10 to 0.67). For intravention, BMSM with greater family proportion were more likely to discourage GS (AOR 3.83, 95% CI: 1.56 to 9.43) and SDU (AOR 2.18, 95% CI: 1.35 to 3.54) among their MSM friend network. Moreover, increased male family network proportion was associated with lower HIV risk and greater intravention than increased female network proportion. CONCLUSIONS: Nearly half of BMSM have a close family member with whom they share personal information. Combination prevention interventions might be made more potent if this often overlooked component of personal networks was incorporated.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We evaluated network mixing and influences by network members upon Black men who have sex with men. METHODS: We conducted separate social and sexual network mixing analyses to determine the degree of mixing on risk behaviors (e.g., unprotected anal intercourse [UAI]). We used logistic regression to assess the association between a network "enabler" (would not disapprove of the respondent's behavior) and respondent behavior. RESULTS: Across the sample (n = 1187) network mixing on risk behaviors was more assortative (like with like) in the sexual network (r(sex), 0.37-0.54) than in the social network (r(social), 0.21-0.24). Minimal assortativity (heterogeneous mixing) among HIV-infected men on UAI was evident. Black men who have sex with men reporting a social network enabler were more likely to practice UAI (adjusted odds ratio = 4.06; 95% confidence interval = 1.64, 10.05) a finding not observed in the sexual network (adjusted odds ratio = 1.31; 95% confidence interval = 0.44, 3.91). CONCLUSIONS: Different mixing on risk behavior was evident with more disassortativity among social than sexual networks. Enabling effects of social network members may affect risky behavior. Attention to of high-risk populations' social networks is needed for effective and sustained HIV prevention.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine how history of criminal justice involvement (CJI) is related to HIV care continuum metrics among young black MSM 16-29 years of age. DESIGN: Population-based survey. METHODS: From 2013 to 2014, a representative sample of young black MSM was generated using respondent-driven sampling (RDS) in Chicago (n = 618). HIV antibody/antigen and RNA testing were performed using dry blood spots. Factors assessed in the care continuum included HIV testing, HIV diagnosis, linkage to care within 6 months, retention in care, adherence to antiretrovirals, and viral suppression. RDS-weighted regression models examined the associations between history of CJI, including frequency of CJI and durations of stay and each of the continuum metrics. RESULTS: A final analytic sample of 618 participants was generated through RDS chains of up to 13 waves in length and with a mean of 2.1 recruits per participant. At enrollment, 40.8% had prior history of CJI and 34.6% were HIV seropositive. Of persons reporting HIV seropositive status, 58.4% were linked to care, 40.2% were retained in care, 32.2% were adherent to antiretrovirals, and 24.3% were virally suppressed. Any CJI history was associated with the overall care continuum (adjusted odds ratio = 2.35; 95% confidence interval 1.13-4.88) and was most associated with increased retention in care [adjusted odds ratio = 3.72 (1.77-7.84)]. Having one CJI experience and detention for only 1 day was associated with better retention in care compared with no or more frequent CJI. CONCLUSION: Those with a previous history of CJI were more successful in achieving most HIV care continuum metrics. Frequent and cycling CJI, however, was detrimental to HIV care.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We tested preliminary efficacy of a peer change agent type I network intervention to increase pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) linkage to care among network members connected to young Black men who have sex with men. DESIGN: Parent study is a pragmatic randomized controlled trial with 110 weeks of total follow-up. Interim midpoint analyses are performed here using participant data before crossover assignment at 55 weeks. METHODS: We randomly assigned 423 participants in Chicago to receive the network intervention, an opinion leader workshop with telephonic booster sessions, versus a time-matched control from 2016 to 2018. The consolidated surrogate outcome was PrEP referral and linkage to clinical care among network members connected to study participants and was collected from independent administrative data. RESULTS: Each study participant in the trial (n = 423) had on average 1822 network contacts who could be eligible for PrEP referral and linkage. During the 55-week observation period, PrEP referral was most likely to occur within 3 days of an intervention session compared to control [odds ratio (OR) 0.07 (0.02-0.013); P = 0.007] resulting in 1-2 referrals of network members per session. Network members with referral or linkage were more likely to be connected to study participants in the intervention arm than the control condition [aOR 1.50 (1.09-2.06); P = 0.012]. CONCLUSIONS: A peer change agent type I network intervention is preliminarily effective at diffusing PrEP through a network of individuals highly susceptible to HIV over 55 weeks. This low-intensity intervention demonstrated network-level impact among populations that have experienced limited PrEP care engagement in the United States.

AB  - Continued research with sexual and gender minority (SGM) youth is essential both to understand health disparities and to develop interventions targeting those disparities, but conducting rigorous, ethical research with these populations remains a substantial challenge. In addition to considerations for research with adolescents in general, such as utilizing developmentally appropriate measures and obtaining parental permission, factors unique to SGM youth must be addressed at every step of the research process. Defining the study population is complex, as is recruiting a sample once it is defined. Measurement is another challenge, given the paucity of measures developed for or validated with SGM samples. Key constructs, such as sexual orientation, gender identity, and family acceptance, are not amenable to randomization and involving minor participants' parents poses ethical concerns given the precarious home and safety situations that can arise from employing typical study procedures with youth who have a stigmatized identity. In this article, we examine some of these unique methodological challenges. Informed by theoretical and empirical literature, practical experience, and an ongoing dialogue with SGM youth themselves, we present a guide to best practices for ethical, productive research with SGM youth. By discussing existing approaches to studying SGM youth and suggesting innovative ways to approach the questions that remain, we hope to assist the research community in addressing methodological gaps to advance research on SGM youth in relation to families and schools.

AB  - Improved implementation of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) should be a valuable tool within communities experiencing high HIV incidence, such as black men who have sex with men (MSM). Using baseline data from the Chicago arm of the Transmission Reduction Intervention Project (TRIP), we examined awareness and use of PrEP within HIV potential transmission networks. Transmission Reduction Intervention Project recruited participants ages 18-69 (N = 218) during 2014-2016 from networks originating from recently and chronically HIV-infected MSM and transgender persons. In total, 53.2% of participants had heard of PrEP, while 8 (6.5%) HIV-negative participants reported ever using PrEP. In multivariable regression, PrEP awareness was associated with identifying as gay, attending some college or higher, having an HIV test in the previous 6 months, and experiencing HIV-related social support. PrEP awareness was not associated with experiencing or observing HIV-related stigma. PrEP use was associated with participants knowing two or more other PrEP-users. These findings demonstrate moderate awareness, but low uptake of PrEP within HIV potential transmission networks in Chicago. Future research should explore how to increase PrEP use in these networks and investigate the social dynamics behind our finding that PrEP users are more likely to know other PrEP users.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To provide data on the short-term effect of intravitreal bevacizumab for diabetic macular edema (DME). DESIGN: Randomized phase II clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred twenty-one eyes of 121 subjects (109 eligible for analysis) with DME and Snellen acuity equivalent ranging from 20/32 to 20/320. INTERVENTIONS: Random assignment to 1 of 5 groups: (A) focal photocoagulation at baseline (n = 19), (B) intravitreal injection of 1.25 mg of bevacizumab at baseline and 6 weeks (n = 22), (C) intravitreal injection of 2.5 mg of bevacizumab at baseline and 6 weeks (n = 24), (D) intravitreal injection of 1.25 mg of bevacizumab at baseline and sham injection at 6 weeks (n = 22), or (E) intravitreal injection of 1.25 mg of bevacizumab at baseline and 6 weeks with photocoagulation at 3 weeks (n = 22). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Central subfield thickness (CST) on optical coherence tomography and best-corrected visual acuity (VA) were measured at baseline and after 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 weeks. RESULTS: At baseline, median CST was 411 mum and median Snellen VA equivalent was 20/50. Compared with group A, groups B and C had a greater reduction in CST at 3 weeks and about 1 line better median VA over 12 weeks. There were no meaningful differences between groups B and C in CST reduction or VA improvement. A CST reduction > 11% (reliability limit) was present at 3 weeks in 36 of 84 (43%) bevacizumab-treated eyes and 5 of 18 (28%) eyes treated with laser alone, and at 6 weeks in 31 of 84 (37%) and 9 of 18 (50%) eyes, respectively. Combining focal photocoagulation with bevacizumab resulted in no apparent short-term benefit or adverse outcomes. Endophthalmitis developed in 1 eye. The following events occurred during the first 24 weeks in subjects treated with bevacizumab without attributing cause to the drug: myocardial infarction (n = 2), congestive heart failure (n = 1), elevated blood pressure (n = 3), and worsened renal function (n = 3). CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that intravitreal bevacizumab can reduce DME in some eyes, but the study was not designed to determine whether treatment is beneficial. A phase III trial would be needed for that purpose.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The guidelines for applying individual adjustments to macaques according to the severity of behavioral symptoms during 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) treatment were provided to reproduce stable chronic Parkinsonism in a recent study (Potts et al., 2014). But, since there are insufficient guidelines regarding objective severity criteria of individual symptoms for adjustments of MPTP treatment, it is difficult to develop MPTP-induced chronic non-human primate (NHP) models with stable symptoms. NEW METHOD: The individual adjustments of MPTP administration based on results of automatic quantification of global activity (GA) using a video-based tracking system were applied to develop MPTP-PD model. Low-dose (0.2 mg/kg) intramuscular injection was repeated continuously until GA was lower than 8% of baseline Parkinsonian behavior scores. The positron emission tomography imaging were used to follow the longitudinal course of Parkinson's disease (PD). RESULTS: Significant reductions in GA and dopamine transporter activity, along with significant increases in Parkinsonian behavior scores were found from 4 to 48 weeks following the first administration. GA was correlated with the Parkinsonian behavior score. The dopamine transporter activity was correlated with GA and the Parkinsonian behavior score. However, it was not correlated with the total dose of MPTP. Damage of dopaminergic neuronal systems in the basal ganglia was confirmed by immunohistochemistry and Western blot. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD: This study reinforces previous guidelines regarding production of NHP models with stable Parkinsonian symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: This novel strategy of MPTP administration based on global activity evaluations provides an important conceptual advance for the development of chronic NHP Parkinsonian models.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Multicentric Castleman's disease (CD) is commonly associated with poor prognosis, and well-known prognostic factors are scarce. We performed a retrospective analysis to define the clinical features and prognostic factors for patients with multicentric CD. METHODS: Between 1990 and 2013, 32 patients with multicentric CD were identified from the database of the Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea. Clinicopathologic data were collected by reviewing the medical records. With the exclusion of 4 patients because of unknown human immunodeficiency virus infection status, 28 human immunodeficiency virus-negative patients with multicentric CD were included in this analysis. RESULTS: Most of the patients were male (76%) and had a median age of 54 years. Hyaline vascular variant was the most common subtype (N=11, 39%). Hepatosplenomegaly (61%), fever (39%), edema (29%), and ascites (18%) were the most frequently reported symptoms and signs at diagnosis. With a median follow-up of 67 months, the 5-year overall survival (OS) was 77%. Patients with extravascular fluid accumulation (i.e., peripheral edema, ascites, and/or pleural effusions) were significantly associated with a poor survival rate (5-year OS, 94% vs. 56%; P=0.04). The extent of disease involvement was also a significant prognostic factor (5-year OS, 91% for involvement on a single side vs. 73% on both sides of the diaphragm; P=0.03). Other clinicopathologic factors were not significantly associated with patient survival. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the hyaline vascular variant is not a rare subtype of multicentric CD. Extravascular fluid accumulation and disseminated disease involvement seem to be significant prognostic factors.

AB  - The concept of coverage first emerged in the 1960s as a key indicator for measuring the proportion of populations that were covered by health care. In the area of HIV interventions among injecting drug users, the term "coverage" has been used for widely different aspects of reach and effectiveness of programmes. This paper reviews an array of ways of thinking about coverage from the scientific and grey literature and discusses methods of estimating coverage, finding that some measures of coverage refer to individuals, others to populations and others to populations covered by services. Nomenclature for these various types of "coverage" are discussed and recommendations are provided for future attempts to measure coverage of harm reduction interventions.

AB  - Urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) is implicated in the regulation of hepatic regeneration by activating hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). Here, we investigated its role in the hepatic regeneration after Fas-mediated massive hepatocyte death employing mice deficient in either uPA or its inhibitor, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). We measured kinetics of hepatic levels of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-labeling index, plasmin activity, mature HGF, and its phosphorylated receptor, c-Met. In the genetically targeted and wild-type mice, hepatocytes fell into the same extent of apoptosis 6 to 12 hours after an intraperitoneal injection with anti-Fas antibody, as judged from histologic analysis and a histon-DNA enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In the wild-type mice, mature HGF emerged in the liver 6 hours following anti-Fas injection, and hepatic PCNA-labeling index started to increase following 24 hours and peaked at 48 hours. In the uPA(-/-) mice, emergence of mature HGF was delayed 12 hours and hepatic regeneration peaked at 96 hours. Supplementation with the uPA gene to the uPA(-/-) mice by in vivo lipofection restored hepatic plasmin levels, and improved a delay in the expression of both mature HGF and phosphorylated c-Met, accompanying a normal rate of liver regeneration. In contrast, PAI-1(-/-) mice showed accelerated liver regeneration; mature HGF emerged as early as 3 hours, and PCNA-labeling index increased at 24 hours. This accelerated regeneration was abolished by administration with anti-HGF antibody. These results strongly suggest a physiologic role of uPA in the proteolytic maturation of HGF, and thereby in hepatic regeneration after Fas-mediated massive hepatocyte death.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Social network analysis was used to examine whether peer influence from one's social networks moderates obesity prevention program effects on obesity-related behaviors: healthful and unhealthful. METHODS: Participants included 557 children residing in Southern California. The survey assessed health-promoting behaviors (i.e., physical activity at school, physical activity outside of school, and fruit and vegetable intake), as well as unhealthful behaviors (high-calorie, low-nutrient intake and sedentary activity), and peer exposure calculated from social network nominations as indicators of peer influence. Multilevel models were conducted separately on outcomes predicted by program participation, peer exposure, and program participation by peer exposure. RESULTS: Results indicated that peer exposure was positively associated with one's own healthful and unhealthful behaviors. Program participation effects were moderated by peer influence, but only when unhealthful peer influence was present. Results suggest that peer influence can diminish or amplify prevention programs CONCLUSION: Future interventions should consider peer-led components to promote healthful influence of peers on healthful and unhealthful behaviors, and programs should be mindful that their effects are moderated by social networks.

AB  - Continuous wound infusion with local anesthesia is an effective method for reducing postoperative pain after laparoscopic colorectal surgery. However, most subcutaneous local anesthesia is delivered through continuous injection, which can be inconvenient for patients. This study compared the effectiveness of postoperative pain relief from the application of a local poloxamer 407-based ropivacaine hydrogel (Gel) to the incision site with continuous infusion-type ropivacaine administration (On-Q) in patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal surgery. This prospective, randomized, non-inferiority study included 61 patients who underwent laparoscopic colorectal surgery with an incision length of 3-6 cm. All 61 patients were randomly assigned to the Gel group (poloxamer 407-based 0.75% ropivacaine, 22.5 mg) or the On-Q group (0.2% ropivacaine, 4 mg/hour for two days). Postoperative analgesia was induced in all patients with intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IV-PCA). The outcome measures, which were assessed for 72 h after surgery, included the total amount of fentanyl consumed via IV-PCA (primary endpoint), and the amount of rescue analgesia (pethidine) and postoperative pain intensity assessed using a numeric rating scale (NRS) [secondary endpoints]. The Gel was administered to 31 patients and On-Q was used for 30 patients. There was no significant difference in the total usage of fentanyl between the two groups (Gel group, 1623.98 mcg; On-Q group, 1595.12 mcg; P = 0.806). There was also no significant difference in the frequency of analgesic rescue medication use (P = 0.213) or NRS scores (postoperative 6 h, P = 0.860; 24 h, P = 0.333; 48 h, P = 0.168; and 72 h, P = 0.655) between the two groups. The Gel, which continuously delivers a local anesthetic to operative sites, can thus be considered an effective device for analgesia and pain relief for midline incisions in laparoscopic colorectal surgery.

AB  - C-C chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) is a clinically proven target for inhibition of HIV-1 infection and a potential target for various inflammatory diseases. In this article, we describe 5-[(4-{(3S)-4-[(1R,2R)-2-ethoxy-5-(trifluoromethyl)-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-yl]-3-methylpiperazin-1-yl}-4-methylpiperidin-1-yl)carbonyl]-4,6-dimethylpyrimidine dihydrochloride (INCB9471), a potent and specific inhibitor of human CCR5 that has been proven to be safe and efficacious in viral load reduction in phase I and II human clinical trails. INCB9471 was identified using a primary human monocyte-based radioligand competition binding assay. It potently inhibited macrophage inflammatory protein-1β-induced monocyte migration and infection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells by a panel of R5-HIV-1 strains. The results from binding and signaling studies using incremental amounts of INCB9471 demonstrated INCB9471 as a noncompetitive CCR5 inhibitor. The CCR5 residues that are essential for interaction with INCB9471 were identified by site-specific mutagenesis studies. INCB9471 rapidly associates with but slowly dissociates from CCR5. When INCB9471 was compared with three CCR5 antagonists that had been tested in clinical trials, the potency of INCB9471 in blocking CCR5 ligand binding was similar to those of 4,6-dimethyl-5-{[4-methyl-4-((3S)-3-methyl-4-{(1R0-2-(methyloxy)-1-[4-(trifluoromethyl) phenyl]ethyl}-1-piperazingyl)-1-piperidinyl]carbonyl}pyrimidine (SCH-D; vicriviroc), 4-{[4-({(3R)-1-butyl-3-[(R)-cyclohexyl(hydroxyl)methyl]-2, 5-dioxo-1,4,9-triazaspiro[5.5]undec-9-yl}methyl)phenyl]oxy}benzoic acid hydrochloride (873140; aplaviroc), and 4,4-difluoro-N-((1S)-3-{(3-endo)-3-[3-methyl-5-(1-methylethyl)-4H-1,2,4-triazol-4-yl]-8-azabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-8-yl}-1-phenylpropyl)cyclohexanecarboxamide (UK427857; maraviroc). Its inhibitory activity against CCR5-mediated Ca(2+) mobilization was also similar to those of SCH-D and 873140. Further analysis suggested that INCB9471 and UK427857 may have different binding sites on CCR5. The significance of two CCR5 antagonists with different binding sites is discussed in the context of potentially overcoming drug-resistant HIV-1 strains.

AB  - To infect target cells, HIV-1 employs a virally encoded transmembrane protein (gp41) to fuse its viral envelope with the target cell plasma membrane. We describe the gp41 ectodomain as comprised of N- and C-terminal subdomains, each containing a heptad repeat as well as a fusogenic region, whose organization is mirrored by the intervening loop region. Recent evidence indicates that the gp41 directed fusion reaction proceeds to initial pore formation prior to gp41 folding into its low energy hairpin conformation. This implies that exposed regions of the gp41 ectodomain are responsible for the bulk of the fusion work, probably through direct protein-membrane interactions. Prevalent fusion models contend that the gp41 ectodomain initially interacts with the target cell surface through its highly hydrophobic N terminus, which is believed to insert into the target membrane, thereby linking the virus to the target cell. This arrangement allows the N-terminal subdomain to interact with the target cell surface, whereas the C-terminal subdomain remains proximal to the virion, allowing interaction with the viral envelope. The composition of the viral envelope and the target cell surface differ due to the virus budding from raft microdomains. We show here that constructs corresponding to the C-terminal subdomain specifically destabilize ordered and cholesterol rich membranes (33 molar %), whereas the N-terminal subdomain is more effective in fusing both unordered cholesterol-free membranes and those containing lower amounts of cholesterol (10 molar %). Moreover we show that, in the context of the C-terminal subdomain, the heptad repeat contributes helical structure, which may describe the enhanced inhibitory effect of the C-terminal subdomain relative to the C-terminal heptad repeat (C34) alone. Our results are discussed in light of recent findings that showcase the role of exposed gp41 regions in effecting membrane fusion.

AB  - Epidural catheter migration is a well-known cause of failed anesthesia and complications. One of the factors that affect catheter movement is when patients change their position after skin fixation. We report a case of an epidural catheter placed without evidence of intravascular or subdural insertion that produced an insufficient block. A 36-year-old woman presented for ankle surgery under epidural anesthesia. Epidural block was conducted at the L3-4 intervertebral space with a catheter threaded 3 cm into the epidural space with the patient in a back flexion and lateral position. The total volume of injected anesthetic was 28 mL, including a 3-mL test dose. The final anesthesia level was L1. The planned operation was completed without a pneumatic tourniquet. A postoperative C-arm fluoroscopic image revealed that 1 side hole of the catheter had moved out of the epidural space. We think that a positional change after catheter fixation was the reason for catheter outmigration leading to insufficient analgesia, which was incompatible with the amount of local anesthetic injected.

AB  - The COVID-19 related U.S.-Mexico border-crossing restrictions disrupted social networks and HIV harm reduction services among people who inject drugs (PWID) in San Diego and Tijuana. We assessed associations of descriptive network norms on PWID's HIV vulnerability during this period. Between 10/2020 and 10/2021, 399 PWID completed a behavioral and egocentric questionnaire. We used Latent Profile Analysis to categorize PWID into network norm risk profiles based on proportions of their network (n = 924 drug use alters) who injected drugs and engaged in cross-border drug use (CBDU), among other vulnerabilities. We used logistic and linear regressions to assess network profile associations with individual-level index of HIV vulnerability and harm reduction behaviors. Fit indices specified a 4-latent profile solution of descriptive network risk norms: lower (n = 178), moderate with (n = 34) and without (n = 94) CBDU and obtainment, and higher (n = 93). Participants in higher risk profiles reported more HIV vulnerability behaviors and fewer harm reduction behaviors. PWID's gradient of HIV risk was associated with network norms, warranting intervention on high-vulnerability networks when services are limited.

AB  - Individual-level behavior can be influenced by injunctive and descriptive social network norms surrounding that behavior. There is a need to understand how the influence of social norms within an individual's social networks may influence individual-level sexual behavior. We aimed to typologize the network-level norms of sexual behaviors within the social networks of Black sexual and gender minoritized groups (SGM) assigned male at birth. Survey data were collected in Chicago, Illinois, USA, between 2018 and 2019 from Black SGM. A total of 371 participants provided individual-level information about sociodemographic characteristics and HIV vulnerability from sex (i.e., condomless sex, group sex, use of alcohol/drugs to enhance sex) and completed an egocentric network inventory assessing perceptions of their social network members' (alters') injunctive and descriptive norms surrounding sexual behaviors with increased HIV vulnerability. We used Latent Profile Analysis (LPA) to identify network-level norms based on the proportion of alters' approval of the participant engaging in condomless sex, group sex, and use of drugs to enhance sex (i.e., injunctive norms) and alters' engagement in these behaviors (i.e., descriptive norms). We then used binomial regression analyses to examine associations between network-level norm profiles and individual-level HIV vulnerability from sex. The results of our LPA indicated that our sample experienced five distinct latent profiles of network-level norms: (1) low HIV vulnerability network norm, (2) moderately high HIV vulnerability network norm, (3) high HIV vulnerability network norm, (4) condomless sex dominant network norm, and (5) approval of drug use during sex dominant network norm. Condomless anal sex, group sex, and using drugs to enhance sex were positively and significantly associated with higher HIV vulnerability social network norm profiles, relative to low HIV vulnerability norm profiles. To mitigate Black SGM's HIV vulnerability, future HIV risk reduction strategies can consider using network-level intervention approaches such as opinion leaders, segmentation, induction, or alteration, through an intersectionality framework.

AB  - Understanding and reshaping cellular behaviors with synthetic gene networks requires the ability to sense and respond to changes in the intracellular environment. Intracellular proteins are involved in almost all cellular processes, and thus can provide important information about changes in cellular conditions such as infections, mutations, or disease states. Here we report the design of a modular platform for intrabody-based protein sensing-actuation devices with transcriptional output triggered by detection of intracellular proteins in mammalian cells. We demonstrate reporter activation response (fluorescence, apoptotic gene) to proteins involved in hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and Huntington's disease, and show sensor-based interference with HIV-1 downregulation of HLA-I in infected T cells. Our method provides a means to link varying cellular conditions with robust control of cellular behavior for scientific and therapeutic applications.

AB  - A diamido diacid diphenyl fulleroid derivative (2c) was designed specifically to inhibit an HIV enzyme. The detailed synthesis and mass spectrometric analysis of the water-soluble, biologically active methanofullerene are described. The compound was prepared in three steps from C60 via a suitably substituted diphenyldiazomethane. High-resolution mass spectrometric analysis was possible only under mild matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization Fourier transform mass spectrometry conditions. Direct infrared or ultraviolet laser desorption resulted exclusively in observation of C60 ions, in either positive or negative mode.

AB  - Knowledge of AIDS, attitudes toward AIDS and condoms, and behavioral changes because of AIDS were studied in 771 students, Grades 9-12 (mean age, 16 years) who completed anonymous questionnaires in gym classes of a New York City high school. Students demonstrated good knowledge of AIDS, with some misconceptions, and significant concerns about AIDS, with some behavioral changes, but most continued to engage in high-risk behaviors. These data indicate that efforts aimed at HIV/AIDS prevention in adolescents must translate knowledge and concerns into behavioral change.

AB  - Many methods for efficient production of transgenic animals for biomedical research have been developed. Despite great improvements in transgenesis rates resulting from the use of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), the ICSI-based sperm-mediated gene-transfer (iSMGT) technique is still not optimal in terms of sperm permeabilization efficiency and subsequent development. Here, we demonstrate that streptolysin-O (SLO) can efficiently permeabilize mouse spermatozoa, leading to improved developmental competence and high transgenesis rates in iSMGT embryos and pups. In particular, the most efficient production of iSMGT-transgenic embryos resulted from pretreatment with 5 U/ml SLO for 30 min and co-incubation with 1.0 ng/µl of an EGFP expression vector. By incubating spermatozoa with Cy-3-labelled DNA, we found that fluorescence intensity was prominently detected in the head region of SLO-treated spermatozoa. In addition, blastocyst development rate and blastomere survival were greatly improved by iSMGT using SLO-treated spermatozoa (iSMGT-SLO) as compared to freeze-thawed spermatozoa. Consistent with this, a high proportion of transgenic offspring was obtained by iSMGT-SLO after transfer into foster mothers, reaching 10.6% of the number of oocytes used (42.3% among pups). Together with successful germline transmission of transgenes in all founders analyzed, our data strongly suggest that SLO makes spermatozoa amenable to exogenous DNA uptake, and that the iSMGT-SLO technique is an efficient method for production of transgenic animals for biomedical research.

AB  - Injection drug initiation usually requires assistance by someone who already injects drugs. To develop interventions that prevent people from starting to inject drugs, it is imperative to understand why people who inject drugs (PWID) assist with injection initiation. METHODS: Injection initiation history and motives for initiating others were collected from 978 PWID in Los Angeles and San Francisco, CA, from 2016-17. This article documents motivations for providing injection initiation assistance and examines demographic, economic, and health-related factors associated with these motivations using multivariable logistic regression modeling. RESULTS: Among the 405 PWID who ever facilitated injection initiation, motivations for initiating were: injury prevention (66%), skilled at injecting others (65%), to avoid being pestered (41%), in exchange for drugs/money (45%), and for food/shelter/transportation (15%). High frequency initiation (>5 lifetime injection initiations) was associated with all motivations except for being pestered. Initiation to prevent injury was associated with being female. Initiation due to pestering was associated with recycling income and sex work. Being skilled was associated with age and HIV status, while initiation for money or drugs was associated with age, race, education, social security income, and substance use treatment. Lastly, initiation for food, shelter, or transportation was associated with age, sexual orientation and education level. CONCLUSION: Diverse factors were associated with reported motivations for assisting someone to initiate injection for the first time. Our analysis underscores the need for prevention strategies focused on improving economic and housing conditions along with implementing drug consumption rooms to disrupt the social processes of injection initiation.

AB  - We recently reported laser-triggered release of photosensitive compounds from liposomes containing dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and 1,2 bis(tricosa-10,12-diynoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DC(8,9)PC). We hypothesized that the permeation of photoactivated compounds occurs through domains of enhanced fluidity in the liposome membrane and have thus called them "Pocket" liposomes. In this study we have encapsulated the red light activatable anticancer photodynamic therapy drug 2-(1-Hexyloxyethyl)-2-devinyl pyropheophorbide-a (HPPH) (Ex/Em410/670 nm) together with calcein (Ex/Em490/517 nm) as a marker for drug release in Pocket liposomes. A mole ratio of 7.6:1 lipid:HPPH was found to be optimal, with >80% of HPPH being included in the liposomes. Exposure of liposomes with a cw-diode 660 nm laser (90 mW, 0-5 minutes) resulted in calcein release only when HPPH was included in the liposomes. Further analysis of the quenching ratios of liposome-entrapped calcein in the laser treated samples indicated that the laser-triggered release occurred via the graded mechanism. In vitro studies with MDA-MB-231-LM2 breast cancer cell line showed significant cell killing upon treatment of cell-liposome suspensions with the laser. To assess in vivo efficacy, we implanted MDA-MB-231-LM2 cells containing the luciferase gene along the mammary fat pads on the ribcage of mice. For biodistribution experiments, trace amounts of a near infrared lipid probe DiR (Ex/Em745/840 nm) were included in the liposomes. Liposomes were injected intravenously and laser treatments (90 mW, 0.9 cm diameter, for an exposure duration ranging from 5-8 minutes) were done 4 hours postinjection (only one tumor per mouse was treated, keeping the second flank tumor as control). Calcein release occurred as indicated by an increase in calcein fluorescence from laser treated tumors only. The animals were observed for up to 15 days postinjection and tumor volume and luciferase expression was measured. A significant decrease in luciferase expression and reduction in tumor volume was observed only in laser treated animal groups injected with liposomes containing HPPH. Histopathological examination of tumor tissues indicated tumor necrosis resulting from laser treatment of the HPPH-encapsulated liposomes that were taken up into the tumor area.

AB  - Many long-term injection drug users (IDUs) engage in planning strategies. In this pilot study, we examine the relation of one planning strategy to IDUs' engaging in safer injection practices. Sixty-eight IDUs were recruited in 2010 from a New York City (NYC) needle exchange program and referrals to participate in an innovative Staying Safe Intervention that teaches strategies to stay HIV/HCV uninfected. Responses to a baseline 185-item survey were analyzed using correlations and odds ratios. Planning ahead to have steady access to clean equipment was correlated with both individually based and networks-based safety behaviors including storing clean needles; avoiding sharing needles, cookers, and filters with other injectors; and providing clean needles to sex partners. Implications related to resilience in IDUs are discussed and the study's limitations have been noted.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Scale-up of hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment for HIV/HCV coinfected individuals is occurring in Spain, the vast majority (> 85%) with a reported history of injecting drug use and a smaller population of co-infected men who have sex with men (MSM). We assess impact of recent treatment scale-up to people living with HIV (PLWH) and implications for achieving the WHO HCV incidence elimination target (80% reduction 2015-2030) among PLWH and overall in Andalusia, Spain, using dynamic modeling. METHODS: A dynamic transmission model of HCV/HIV coinfection was developed. The model was stratified by people who inject drugs (PWID) and MSM. The PWID component included dynamic HCV transmission from the HCV-monoinfected population. The model was calibrated to Andalusia based on published data and the HERACLES cohort (prospective cohort of HIV/HCV coinfected individuals representing > 99% coinfected individuals in care in Andalusia). From HERACLES, we incorporated HCV treatment among diagnosed PLWH of 10.5%/year from 2004 to 2014, and DAAs at 33%/year from 2015 with 94.8% SVR. We project the impact of current and scaled-up HCV treatment for PLWH on HCV prevalence and incidence among PLWH and overall. RESULTS: Current treatment rates among PLWH (scaled-up since 2015) could substantially reduce the number of diagnosed coinfected individuals (mean 76% relative reduction from 2015 to 2030), but have little impact on new diagnosed coinfections (12% relative reduction). However, DAA scale-up to PWLH in 2015 would have minimal future impact on new diagnosed coinfections (mean 9% relative decrease from 2015 to 2030). Similarly, new cases of HCV would only reduce by a mean relative 29% among all PWID and MSM due to ongoing infection/reinfection. Diagnosing/treating all PLWH annually from 2020 would increase the number of new HCV infections among PWLH by 28% and reduce the number of new HCV infections by 39% among the broader population by 2030. CONCLUSION: Targeted scale-up of HCV treatment to PLWH can dramatically reduce prevalence among this group but will likely have little impact on the annual number of newly diagnosed HIV/HCV coinfections. HCV microelimination efforts among PWLH in Andalusia and settings where a large proportion of PLWH have a history of injecting drug use will require scaled-up HCV diagnosis and treatment among PLWH and the broader population at risk.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Associations have been observed between an aggregate viral load measure, the community viral load, and new HIV diagnoses. The community viral load aggregates viral loads within chosen geographic areas, restricting inferences about HIV acquisition risk to these areas. We develop a more precise metric, the network viral load (NVL), to measure the composite viral load within a risk network of a HIV-negative individual. METHODS: We examined the relationship between NVL and HIV infection among young men who have sex with men in Chicago, United States. Networks were generated using respondent-driven sampling. NVL was defined as the prevalence of viremic individuals in one's risk network, characterized as those with a viral load ≥20 k copies per milliliter. Permutation tests were conducted to account for dependency. RESULTS: After controlling for total connections, age, substance use during sex, syphilis diagnosis (previous 12 months), and frequency of condomless anal sex (previous 6 months), we found a positive association between NVL and HIV infection. Compared with a network with all HIV-seronegative members, the odds of HIV infection with an NVL of <10% viremia were 1.85 (95% confidence interval: 1.18 to 2.92) times higher and those with an NVL of ≥10% viremia were 2.73 (95% confidence interval: 1.54 to 4.85) times higher. CONCLUSIONS: We found a positive association between NVL and HIV seroprevalence. Although limited in its ability to infer causality, NVL could have substantial public health implications for persons most at risk for HIV infection, given that this novel metric avoids overreliance on individual level behavior or broad community indices.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Incident HIV infections persist in the United States (U.S.) among marginalized populations. Targeted and cost-efficient testing strategies can help in reaching HIV elimination. This analysis compares the effectiveness and cost of three HIV testing strategies in a high HIV burden area in the U.S. in identifying new HIV infections. METHODS: We performed a cost analysis comparing three HIV testing strategies in Chicago: (1) routine screening (RS) in an inpatient and outpatient setting, (2) modified partner services (MPS) among networks of the recently HIV infected and diagnosed, and (3) a respondent drive sampling (RDS)-based social network (SN) approach targeting young African-American men who have sex with men. All occurred at the same academic medical centre during the following times: routine testing, 2011 to 2016; MPS, 2013 to 2016; SN: 2013 to 2014. Costs were in 2016 dollars and included personnel, HIV testing, training, materials, overhead. Outcomes included cost per test, HIV-positive test and new diagnosis. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the impact of population demographics. RESULTS: The RS programme completed 57,308 HIV tests resulting in 360 (0.6%) HIV-positive tests and 165 new HIV diagnoses (0.28%). The MPS completed 146 HIV tests, resulting in 79 (54%) HIV-positive tests and eight new HIV diagnoses (5%). The SN strategy completed 508 HIV tests, resulting in 210 (41%) HIV-positive tests and 37 new HIV diagnoses (7.2%). Labour accounted for the majority of costs in all strategies. The estimated cost per new HIV diagnosis was $16,773 for the RS programme, $61,418 for the MPS programme and $15,683 for the SN testing programme. These costs were reduced for the RS and MPS strategies in sensitivity analyses limiting testing efficacy to the highest prevalence patient populations ($2,841 and $33,233 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The SN strategy yielded the highest proportion of new diagnoses, followed closely by the MPS programme. Both the SN strategy and RS programme were comparable in the cost per new diagnosis. A simultaneous approach that consists of RS in combination with SN testing may be most effective for identifying new HIV infections in settings with heterogeneous epidemics with both high rates of HIV prevalence and HIV testing.

AB  - OBJECTIVE To characterize recent HIV infections among newly diagnosed men who have sex with men and transgender women in Tijuana. METHODS Limiting Antigen (LAg)-Avidity testing was performed to detect recent HIV infection within a cohort of newly-diagnosed men who have sex with men and transgender women in Tijuana. Logistic regression was used to determine characteristics associated with recent infection. A partial transmission network was inferred using HIV-1 pol sequences. Tamura-Nei 93 genetic distances were measured between all pairs of sequences, and the network was constructed by inferring putative transmission links (genetic distances ≤ 1.5%). We assessed whether recent infection was associated with clustering within the inferred network. RESULTS Recent infection was detected in 11% (22/194) of newly-diagnosed participants. Out of the participants with sequence data, 60% (9/15) with recent infection clustered compared with 31% (43/139) with chronic infection. Two recent infections belonged to the same cluster. In adjusted analyses, recent infection was associated with years of residence in Tijuana (OR = 1.5; 95%CI 1.01-1.09), cocaine use (past month) (OR = 8.50; 95%CI 1.99-28.17), and ever experiencing sexual abuse (OR = 2.85; 95%CI 1.03-7.85). DISCUSSION A total of 11% of men newly diagnosed with HIV who have sex with men and transgender women in Tijuana were recently infected. The general lack of clustering between participants with recent infection suggests continued onward HIV transmission rather than an outbreak within a particular cluster.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Clusters of HIV diagnoses in time and space and clusters of genetically linked cases can both serve as alerts for directing prevention and treatment activities. We assessed the interplay between geography and transmission across the Los Angeles County (LAC) HIV genetic transmission network. METHODS: Deidentified surveillance data reported for 8186 people with HIV residing in LAC from 2010 through 2016 were used to construct a transmission network using HIV-TRACE. We explored geographic assortativity, the tendency for people to link within the same geographic region; concordant time-space pairs, the proportion of genetically linked pairs from the same geographic region and diagnosis year; and Jaccard coefficient, the overlap between geographical and genetic clusters. RESULTS: Geography was assortative in the genetic transmission network but less so than either race/ethnicity or transmission risk. Only 18% of individuals were diagnosed in the same year and location as a genetically linked partner. Jaccard analysis revealed that cis-men and younger age at diagnosis had more overlap between genetic clusters and geography; the inverse association was observed for trans-women and Blacks/African Americans. CONCLUSIONS: Within an urban setting with endemic HIV, genetic clustering may serve as a better indicator than time-space clustering to understand HIV transmission patterns and guide public health action.

AB  - Social-environmental factors may be associated with social network stability, which has implications for HIV acquisition. However, the link between social-environmental factors, network composition and HIV risk has not been examined previously among a city-population based sample of young Black men who have sex with Men (YBMSM). Respondent driven sampling was used to recruit a cohort of 618 YMBSM. Respondents were evaluated at baseline, 9 and 18 months beginning June 2013. A logistic regression model was used to assess the relationship between bridging (i.e. having non-redundant contacts in one's network, indicating network instability) and social-environmental factors and HIV risk factors between respondents, and a conditional logit model was used to assess these relationships within respondents over time. Bridging was associated with adverse social-environmental factors and higher HIV risk, indicating that bridging may be on the explanatory pathway. Future studies should assess the extent to which network stability factors mitigate HIV risk.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Providing HIV healthcare and Treatment as Prevention both depend on diagnosing HIV cases, preferably soon after initial infection. We hypothesized that tracing risk networks recruits higher proportions of undiagnosed positives than outreach-based testing or respondent-driven sampling (RDS) in Odessa, Ukraine. METHODS: The Transmission Reduction Intervention Project (TRIP) used risk network tracing to recruit sexual and injection networks of recently-infected and longer-term infected (LTs) seeds (2013 to 2016). Integrated Biobehavioural Surveillance (IBBS) (2013) used RDS to recruit people who inject drugs (PWID). Outreach Testing tested PWID for HIV at community outreach sites (2013 to 2016). Proportions of undiagnosed positives among those tested were compared TRIP versus IBBS; TRIP versus Outreach Testing and between TRIP arms. Costs were compared across the projects. RESULTS: TRIP tested 1252 people (21% women) in seeds' risk networks; IBBS tested 400 (18% women); Outreach Testing 13,936 (31% women). TRIP networks included a higher proportion of undiagnosed positives (14.6%) than IBBS (5.0%) or Outreach Testing (2.4%); odds ratio (OR) 3.25 (95% CI 2.07, 5.12) versus IBBS and 7.03 (CI 5.95, 8.31) versus Outreach Testing respectively. Findings remained significant in analyses stratified by sex and when PWID in TRIP networks were compared with Outreach Testing and IBBS. Within TRIP, recently-infected participants' networks contained higher proportions of undiagnosed positives (16.3%) than LTs' networks (12.2%); OR 1.41 (CI 1.01, 1.95). TRIP located undiagnosed positives less expensively than did RDS or Outreach Testing. CONCLUSIONS: TRIP's recruiting techniques, including prioritizing networks of the recently infected, find undiagnosed HIV-positive people efficiently. They should be integrated with standard practice to improve case-finding. Research should test these techniques in other socio-epidemiologic contexts.

AB  - Background: Despite the centrality of family in Indian society, relatively little is known about family-based communication concerning sexual behaviour and HIV/AIDS in rural Indian families. To date, very few family-based adolescent HIV-prevention interventions have been developed for rural Indian youth. This study conducted formative research with youth aged 14 to 18 years and their parents in order to assess the feasibility of conducting a family-based HIV-prevention intervention for rural Indian adolescents. Methods: Eight focus groups were conducted (n = 46) with mothers, fathers, adolescent females and adolescent males (two focus groups were held for each of the four groups). All focus groups consisted of same-gender participants. Adolescents aged 14 to 18 years old and their parents were recruited from a tribal community in rural Maharashtra, India. Focus group transcripts were content analyzed to identify themes related to family perceptions about HIV/AIDS and participation in a family-based intervention to reduce adolescent vulnerability to HIV infection. Results: Six primary thematic areas were identified: (1) family knowledge about HIV/AIDS; (2) family perceptions about adolescent vulnerability to HIV infection; (3) feasibility of a family-based programme to prevent adolescent HIV infection; (4) barriers to participation; (5) recruitment and retention strategies; and (6) preferred content for an adolescent HIV prevention intervention. Conclusion: Despite suggestions that family-based approaches to preventing adolescent HIV infection may be culturally inappropriate, our results suggest that a family-based intervention to prevent adolescent HIV infection is feasible if it: (1) provides families with comprehensive HIV prevention strategies and knowledge; (2) addresses barriers to participation; (3) is adolescent friendly, flexible and convenient; and (4) is developmentally and culturally appropriate for rural Indian families.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: The study team investigated costs associated with the ranibizumab port delivery system (PDS) for neovascular age-related macular (nAMD), an alternative to conventional intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) injections. OBJECTIVE: To investigate costs of intravitreal anti-VEGF injections vs ranibizumab PDS for patients with neovascular AMD (nAMD). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cost analysis used trial data and Medicare reimbursement rates and included patients with nAMD who were receiving ranibizumab, aflibercept, bevacizumab injections, or ranibizumab PDS. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The number of intravitreal ranibizumab, aflibercept, and bevacizumab injections to break even with costs of ranibizumab PDS. Total direct medical costs over 1 year and 5 years for the ranibizumab PDS arm with refills at fixed 6-month intervals compared with monthly or bimonthly injections were calculated using Medicare rates. Scenario and sensitivity analyses accounted for uncertainty and variation. RESULTS: The mean (SD) number of ranibizumab, aflibercept, and bevacizumab injections to break even with the cost of ranibizumab PDS with 1 refill was 10.8 (1.3), 9.3 (1.1), and 34.5 (4.2), respectively. Ranibizumab PDS with fixed 6-month refills over 1 year cost $21 016 ($2102). Comparatively, monthly intravitreal ranibizumab cost $1943 (95% CI, -$3047 to $6932; P = .34) more, aflibercept cost $5702 (95% CI, $253-$11 151; P = .04) more, and bevacizumab cost $16 732 (95% CI, -$20 170 to -$13 294, P < .001) less. For bimonthly injections, aflibercept cost $7658 (95% CI, -$11 649.52 to -$3665.61; P = .006) less. Over 5 years, monthly intravitreal ranibizumab projected to cost $25 581 (95% CI, $2275-$48 887; P = .04) more, aflibercept cost $44 374 (95% CI, $18 623-$70 125; P = .008) more, and bevacizumab cost $67 793 (95% CI, -$82 501 to -$53 085; P < .001) less than PDS with fixed refills (mean [SD] cost, $89 218 [$8921]). For bimonthly injections, aflibercept cost $22 422 (95% CI, -$40 287 to -$45,56; P = .03) less. In scenario analyses, ranibizumab PDS with refills as needed offered cost savings compared with real-world intravitreal ranibizumab or aflibercept use at 5 years but not at 1 year. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cost analysis, ranibizumab PDS with 1 refill cost more than intravitreal ranibizumab or aflibercept injections if less than or equal to approximately 11 or 10 injections, respectively, are required within the first year. Long term, if less than 4.4 and 3.8 injections are needed per refill, intravitreal ranibizumab and aflibercept is lower cost. Ranibizumab PDS costs more than intravitreal bevacizumab injections throughout scenarios.

AB  - This paper examines sniffing as a mode of administration among three subgroups who sniff heroin: those who had never injected those who were also injecting, and those who had ceased injection. Modified life-history interviews were conducted in 1994 with 26 people currently sniffing but not injecting, recruited in street-based settings in conjunction with an ongoing study of risk behavior end seroprevalence among drug injectors. These were supplemented by survey interviews and brief open-ended interviews with 23 people who combined heroin injecting with heroin sniffing, recruited from a parallel component of the ongoing study, based at a hospital detoxification ward. Not merely a brief precursor to heroin injecting, heroin sniffing can continue for long periods, and persist during and after periods of injection. Each subgroup uses heroin sniffing to regulate different perceived risks. heroin tolerance and financial expenditure (among those who have never injected), situational risks (among current injectors), and personal crises (among former injectors). These findings suggest the importance of personal factors over syringe availability or fear of HIV in use of modes of heroin administration.

AB  - Increasing mortality in intravenous (IV) drug users not reported to surveillance as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) has occurred in New York City coincident with the AIDS epidemic. From 1981 to 1986, narcotics-related deaths increased on average 32% per year from 492 in 1981 to 1996 in 1986. This increase included deaths from AIDS increasing from 0 to 905 and deaths from other causes, many of which were infectious diseases, increasing from 492 to 1091. Investigations of these deaths suggest a causal association with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. These deaths may represent a spectrum of HIV-related disease that has not been identified through AIDS surveillance and has resulted in a large underestimation of the impact of AIDS on IV drug users and blacks and Hispanics.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: In California, injection drug users (IDUs) comprise the second leading risk group for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and the majority of hepatitis C virus (HCV) cases. Innovative disease screening and prevention activities are needed to improve disease surveillance and to guide appropriate public health responses. This study tested the hypothesis that offering HIV counseling and testing (C&T) concurrently with HCV C&T will increase HIV C&T rates among IDUs. METHODS: From February through June 2003, HIV and HCV C&T were integrated in five California local health jurisdictions. HIV C&T and disclosure rates among IDUs were monitored when HIV C&T was offered alone during a baseline phase and when offered with HCV C&T during an intervention phase RESULTS: Among IDUs, HIV C&T rates were significantly higher when HIV and HCV C&T were offered together (27.1%, 354/1,305) than when HIV C&T services were offered alone (8.4%, 138/1,645) (p<0.05). HIV disclosure rates increased from 54.3% (75/138) when only HIV test results were disclosed to 71.8% (254/354) when HIV test results were disclosed concurrently with HCV test results (p<0.05). HCV prevalence among IDUs tested ranged from 23% to 75% at the five project sites. Integrating HIV and HCV C&T increased overall C&T time required for staff and clients and increased stress among counselors due to the number of positive test results (HCV) given to clients. CONCLUSIONS: Study results suggest that integrating HIV and HCV C&T can increase disease screening rates among IDUs. Careful planning of integrated staff activities and schedules is recommended.

AB  - Background: To reduce the impact of depression on people living with HIV, we are implementing a clinic-based behavioral health screener and referral to Optimizing Resilience and Coping with HIV through Internet Delivery, an evidenced-based intervention. We used the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research to identify contextual barriers and facilitators in advance of implementation. Setting: Sixteen Chicagoland area Ryan White Medical Case Management sites. Methods: We conducted a sequential mixed-methods study with medical case managers and supervisors. Participants completed an online survey assessing Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research domains, scored on a 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) scale. Survey results informed a purposive sampling frame and interview protocol. Interviews were analyzed by rapid qualitative analysis. Results: On average, survey respondents (n = 58) slightly agreed with positive views of team culture, learning climate, and implementation readiness (mean = 3.80-3.87). Potential barriers included intervention complexity (mean = 3.47), needed human resources (mean = 2.71-3.33), and only slight agreement with relative advantage over existing screening/referral systems (mean = 3.09-3.71). Qualitative results (n = 15) identified low advantage for clinics with robust behavioral health systems but strong advantage in clinics without these services. Respondents identified system-wide training and monitoring strategies to facilitate implementation. Conclusions: Ryan White Medical Case Management sites are a generally favorable context for the implementation of the interventions. As illustrated in an implementation research logic model, barriers will be addressed through deploying strategies proposed to impact clinic- and individual-level outcomes, including electronic prompts (reduce complexity), training on Optimizing Resilience and Coping with HIV through Internet Delivery as a complement to other behavioral health services (increase relative advantage), and feedback during implementation (strengthen rewards/incentives).

AB  - This paper looks at an innovative approach to AIDS risk reduction among intravenous drug users who are not in treatment. The new method utilizes an organizing model that involves the mobilization of drug users to promote risk reduction. This strategy targets the group as well as the individual for change. Standard outreach techniques have had some success in achieving HIV risk reduction, particularly for behavior that reduces risk through altering drug use behavior, but still leaves many users at risk. Intravenous drug users in the Netherlands and gays in the United States have organized around HIV-related issues with some success. Preliminary evidence from New York City suggests that organizing drug users may be an effective approach for achieving significant HIV risk reduction for individual users as well as those they associate with.

AB  - Beta-defensins are small (3 to 5 kDa in size) secreted antimicrobial and antiviral proteins that are components of innate immunity. Beta-defensins are secreted by epithelial cells, and they are expressed at high levels in several mucosae, including the mouth, where the concentration of these proteins can reach 100 microg/ml. Because of these properties, we wondered whether they could be part of the defenses that lower oral transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) compared to other mucosal sites. Our data show that select beta-defensins, especially human beta-defensin 2 (hBD2) and hBD3, inhibit R5 and X4 HIV infection in a dose-dependent manner at doses that are compatible with or below those measured in the oral cavity. We observed that beta-defensin treatment inhibited accumulation of early products of reverse transcription, as detected by PCR. We could not, however, detect any reproducible inhibition of env-mediated fusion, and we did not observe any modulation of HIV coreceptors following treatment with hBD1 and hBD2, in both resting and phytohemagglutinin-activated cells. Our data instead suggest that, besides a direct inactivation of HIV virions, hBD2 inhibits HIV replication in the intracellular environment. Therefore, we speculate that beta-defensins mediate a novel antiretroviral mechanism that contributes to prevention of oral HIV transmission in the oral cavity. Immunohistochemical data on hBD2 expression in oral mucosal tissue shows that hBD2 is constitutively expressed, forming a barrier layer across the epithelium in healthy subjects, while in HIV-positive subjects levels of hBD2 expression are dramatically diminished. This may predispose HIV-positive subjects to increased incidence of oral complications associated with HIV infection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The optimal duration of preventive therapy for tuberculosis (TB) among HIV-infected persons in TB-endemic countries is unknown. METHODS: An open-label randomized clinical trial was performed and analyzed for equivalence. Seven hundred and twelve HIV-infected, ART-naïve patients without active TB were randomized to receive either ethambutol 800 mg and isoniazid 300 mg daily for six-months (6EH) or isoniazid 300 mg daily for 36-months (36H). Drugs were dispensed fortnightly and adherence checked by home visits. Patients had chest radiograph, sputum smear and culture performed every six months, in addition to investigations if they developed symptoms. The primary endpoint was incident TB while secondary endpoints were all-cause mortality and adverse events. Survival analysis was performed on the modified intent to treat population (m-ITT) and rates compared. FINDINGS: Tuberculosis developed in 22 (6.4%) of 344 subjects in the 6EH arm and 13 (3.8%) of 339 subjects in the 36H arm with incidence rates of 2.4/100 py (95%CI- 1.4-3.5) and 1.6/100 py (95% CI-0.8-3.0) with an adjusted rate ratio (aIRR) of 1.6 (0.8-3.2). Among TST-positive subjects, the aIRR of 6EH was 1.7 (0.6-4.3) compared to 36H, p = 0.8. All-cause mortality and toxicity were similar in the two arms. Among 15 patients with confirmed TB, 4 isolates were resistant to isoniazid and 2 were multidrug-resistant. INTERPRETATION: Both regimens were similarly effective in preventing TB, when compared to historical incidence rates. However, there was a trend to lower TB incidence with 36H. There was no increase in isoniazid resistance compared to the expected rate in HIV-infected patients. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00351702.

AB  - Objectives. We examined HIV prevalence and risk factors among injection drug users (IDUs) in Athens, Greece, during an HIV outbreak. Methods. We used respondent-driven sampling (RDS) to recruit 1404 IDUs to the Aristotle intervention in August to October 2012. We interviewed participants and tested for HIV. We performed bivariate and multivariate analyses. Results. Estimated HIV prevalence was 19.8% (RDS-weighted prevalence = 14.8%). Odds of infection were 2.3 times as high in homeless as in housed IDUs and 2.1 times as high among IDUs who injected at least once per day as among less frequent injectors (both, P < .001). Six percent of men and 23.5% of women reported transactional sex in the past 12 months, and condom use was low. Intercourse with non-IDUs was common (53.2% of men, 25.6% of women). Among IDUs who had been injecting for 2 years or less the estimated incidence rate was 23.4 new HIV cases per 100 person-years at risk. Conclusions. Efforts to reduce HIV transmission should address homelessness as well as scaling up prevention services, such as needle and syringe distribution and other risk reduction interventions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A "seek-test-treat" intervention (ARISTOTLE) was implemented in response to an outbreak of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection among persons who inject drugs (PWID) in Athens. We assess trends in HIV incidence, prevalence, risk behaviors and access to prevention/treatment. METHODS: Methods included behavioral data collection, provision of injection equipment, HIV testing, linkage to opioid substitution treatment (OST) programs and HIV care during 5 rounds of respondent-driven sampling (2012-2013). HIV incidence was estimated from observed seroconversions. RESULTS: Estimated coverage of the target population was 88% (71%-100%; 7113 questionnaires/blood samples from 3320 PWID). The prevalence of HIV infection was 16.5%. The incidence per 100 person-years decreased from 7.8 (95% confidence interval, 4.6-13.1) (2012) to 1.7 (0.55-5.31) (2013; P for trend = .001). Risk factors for seroconversion were frequency of injection, homelessness, and history of imprisonment. Injection at least once daily declined from 45.2% to 18.8% (P < .001) and from 36.8% to 26.0% (P = .007) for sharing syringes, and the proportion of undiagnosed HIV infection declined from 84.3% to 15.0% (P < .001). Current OST increased from 12.2% to 27.7% (P < .001), and 48.4% of unlinked seropositive participants were linked to HIV care through 2013. Repeat participants reported higher rates of adequate syringe coverage, linkage to HIV care and OST. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple evidence-based interventions delivered through rapid recruitment in a large proportion of the population of PWID are likely to have helped mitigate this HIV outbreak.

AB  - Shared decision making (SDM) is a model of patient-provider communication. Little is known about the role of SDM in health disparities among Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) sexual and gender minorities (SGM). We illustrate how issues at the intersection of AAPI and SGM identities affect SDM processes and health outcomes. We discuss experiences of AAPI SGM that are affected by AAPI heterogeneity, SGM stigma, multiple minority group identities, and sources of discrimination. Recommendations for clinical practice, research, policy, community development, and education are offered.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to assess mRNA of IL-6, TNFα and IL-10 cytokines in bone marrow, possible mediators involved in altered bone remodeling with detrimental consequences on bone quality in NGR (Nutritional growth retardation) rats. METHODS: Weanling male Wistar rats were assigned either to control (C) or experimental group (NGR) (n=20 each). C and NGR groups were assigned to 2 groups according to receiving saline solution (SS) or propranolol hydrochloride (P): C, C+P (CP), NGR or NGR+P (NGRP). For 4 weeks, NGR and NGRP rats received 80% of the amount of food consumed by C and CP, respectively, the previous day, corrected by body weight. P (7 mg/kg/day) was injected ip 5 days/week, for 4 weeks in CP and NGRP rats. Body weight and length were recorded. After 4 weeks, blood was drawn. Femurs were dissected for RNA isolation from bone marrow and mRNA of cytokines assays. RESULTS: Food restriction induced a significant negative effect on body growth in NGR and NGRP rats (p<0.001). P had no effects on zoometric parameters (p>0.05). CTX-I increased in NGR rats vs. C (p<0.001), but diminished in NGRP (p<0.01). Serum osteocalcin, PTH, calcium and phosphate levels remained unchanged between groups (p>0.05). In NGR, bone marrow IL-6 mRNA and IL-10 mRNA levels were low as compared to other groups (p<0.05). In contrast, bone marrow TNF-α mRNA levels were significantly high (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidences that NGR outcomes in a bone marrow proinflammatory microenvironment leading to unbalanced bone remodeling by enhancement of bone resorption reverted by propranolol.

AB  - Criminal justice involved (CJI) individuals with a history of opioid use disorder (OUD) are at high risk of overdose and death in the weeks following release from jail. We developed the Justice-Community Circulation Model (JCCM) to investigate OUD/CJI dynamics post-release and the effects of interventions on overdose deaths. The JCCM uses a synthetic agent-based model population of approximately 150,000 unique individuals that is generated using demographic information collected from multiple Chicago-area studies and data sets. We use a high-performance computing (HPC) workflow to implement a sequential approximate Bayesian computation algorithm for calibrating the JCCM. The calibration results in the simulated joint posterior distribution of the JCCM input parameters. The calibrated model is used to investigate the effects of a naloxone intervention for a mass jail release. The simulation results show the degree to which a targeted intervention focusing on recently released jail inmates can help reduce the risk of death from opioid overdose.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Increased preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) uptake among black men who have sex with men and black transgender women (BMSM/TW) is needed to end the HIV epidemic. Embedding a brief intervention in network services that engage individuals in HIV transmission networks for HIV/ sexually transmitted infections testing may be an important strategy to accelerate PrEP uptake. SETTING: Partner Services PrEP study is a pilot, randomized, control trial to improve linkage to PrEP care among BMSM/TW presenting for network services in Chicago, IL, from 2015 to 2017. METHODS: BMSM/TW (N = 146) aged 18-40 years were recruited from network services (partners services and social network strategy services). Intervention participants developed an individualized linkage plan based on the information-motivation-behavioral skills model and received minibooster sessions. Control participants received treatment as usual. Sociodemographic, behavioral, and clinical factors were examined at baseline and 3- and 12-month postintervention. Intent-to-treat analyses examined linkage to PrEP care within 3-month postintervention (primary outcome). Secondary outcomes were PrEP initiation, time to linkage to PrEP care, and time to PrEP initiation. RESULTS: Compared with control participants, a significantly greater proportion of the intervention participants were linked to PrEP care within 3 months (24% vs. 11%; P = 0.04) and initiated PrEP (24% vs. 11%; P = 0.05). Among those linked to PrEP care within the study period, intervention participants were linked significantly sooner than control participants [median (interquartile range) days, 26.5 (6.0-141.8) vs. 191.5 (21.5-297.0); P = 0.05]. CONCLUSION: Study results support the preliminary efficacy of Partner Services PrEP to improve linkage to PrEP care and PrEP initiation among BMSM/TW.

AB  - The interaction between the cumulative effect of psychosocial and structural factors (i.e. syndemic effect) and social networks among young Black transgender women and men who have sex with men (YBTM) remains understudied. A representative cohort of 16-29 year-old YBTM (n = 618) was assessed for syndemic factors [i.e. substance use; community violence; depression; poverty; justice system involvement (JSI)], social network characteristics, condomless anal sex (CAS), group sex (GS), and HIV-infection. The syndemic index significantly increased the odds of CAS, GS, and HIV-infection, and these effects were moderated by network characteristics. Network JSI buffered the effect on CAS, romantic network members buffered the effect on GS, and network age and proportion of family network members buffered the effect on HIV-infection. The proportion of friend network members augmented the effect on GS and HIV-infection. Future research to prevent HIV among YBTM should consider social network approaches that target both structural and psychosocial syndemic factors.

AB  - Over 30 years into the US HIV/AIDS epidemic, Black men who have sex with men (BMSM) continue to carry the highest burden of both HIV and AIDS cases. There is then, an urgent need to expand access to HIV prevention and treatment for all gay and bisexual men, underscoring the importance of the federal initiative 'Ending the Epidemic: A Plan for America'. This research examines structural factors associated with BMSM HIV testing coverage over time (2011-2016) in 85 US Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs). We calculated MSA-specific annual measures of BMSM HIV testing coverage (2011-2016). Variables suggested by the Theory of Community Action (i.e., need, resource availability, institutional opposition and organized support) were analyzed as possible predictors of coverage using multilevel modeling. Relationships between BMSM HIV testing and the following covariates were positive: rates of BMSM living with HIV (b = 0.28), percent of Black residents employed (b = 0.19), Black heterosexual testing rate (b = 0.46), health expenditures per capita (b = 0.16), ACT UP organization presence in 1992 (b = 0.19), and syringe service presence (b = 0.12). Hard drug arrest rates at baseline (b = - 0.21) and change since baseline (b = - 0.10) were inversely associated with the outcome. Need, resources availability, organized support and institutional opposition are important determinants of place associated with BMSM HIV testing coverage. Efforts to reduce HIV incidence and lessen AIDS-related disparities among BMSM in the US require improved and innovative HIV prevention approaches directed toward BMSM including a fuller understanding of structural factors that may influence place variation in BMSM testing patterns and risk behavior in places of high need.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Injection drug users (IDUs) are at high risk for HIV, hepatitis, overdose and other harms. Greater drug treatment availability has been shown to reduce these harms among IDUs. Yet, little is known about changes in drug treatment availability for IDUs in the U.S. This paper investigates change in drug treatment coverage for IDUs in 90 metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) during 1993-2002. METHODS: We define treatment coverage as the percent of IDUs who are in treatment. The number of IDUs in drug treatment is calculated from treatment entry data and treatment census data acquired from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration, divided by our estimated number of IDUs in each MSA. RESULTS: Treatment coverage was low in 1993 (mean 6.7%; median 6.0%) and only increased to a mean of 8.3% and median of 8.0% coverage in 2002. CONCLUSIONS: Although some MSAs experienced increases in treatment coverage over time, overall levels of coverage were low. The persistence of low drug treatment coverage for IDUs represents a failure by the U.S. health care system to prevent avoidable harms and unnecessary deaths in this population. Policy makers should expand drug treatment for IDUs to reduce blood-borne infections and community harms associated with untreated injection drug use.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Our previous research has found low and stable mean drug treatment coverage among people who inject drugs (PWID) across 90 large US metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) during 1993-2002. This manuscript updates previous estimates of change in drug treatment coverage for PWID in 90 MSAs during 1993-2007. METHODS: Our drug treatment sample for calculating treatment coverage includes clients enrolled in residential or ambulatory inpatient/outpatient care, detoxification services, and methadone maintenance therapy at publicly- and privately-funded substance abuse agencies receiving public funds. Coverage was measured as the number of PWID in drug treatment, calculated by using data from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration, divided by numbers of PWID in each MSA. We modeled change in drug treatment coverage rates using a negative binomial mixed-effects model. Fixed-effects included an intercept and a main effect for time. Incidence rate ratios (IRR) were calculated for both average change from 1993 to 2007 and MSA-specific estimates of change in coverage rates. RESULTS: On average over all MSAs, coverage was low in 1993 (6.1%) and showed no improvement from 1993 to 2007 (IRR = 0.99; 95% CI, 0.86, 1.2). There was modest variability across MSAs in coverage in 1993 (log incidence rate SD = 0.36) as well as in coverage change from 1993 to 2007 (log IRR SD = 0.32). In addition, results indicate significant variability among MSAs in coverage. CONCLUSIONS: Inadequate treatment coverage for PWID may produce a high cost to society in terms of the spread of overdose mortality and injection-related infectious diseases. A greater investment in treatment will likely be needed to have a substantial and more consistent impact on injection drug use-related harms. Future research should examine MSA-level predictors associated with variability in drug treatment coverage.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Scientific consensus holds that if, at the outset of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, injection drug users (IDUs) had had better access to sterile syringes, much of the epidemic among IDUs in the U.S. could have been prevented. In the context of preventing infectious diseases, 100% syringe coverage - that is, one sterile syringe per injector for each injection - is a public health goal. Notably, we know little about variations in syringe coverage within the U.S. and elsewhere, or about the social and political factors that might determine this coverage. METHODS: Using data from Holmberg (1996), the 1990 United States Census, the 2000 Beth Israel National Syringe Exchange Survey (n=72), and estimates of IDUs in metropolitan areas (MSAs); (Friedman et al., 2004), we explore the impact of (1) political factors (ACT UP, outreach, early syringe exchange programme (SEP) presence, men who have sex with men (MSM) per capita, drug arrests, and police per capita); (2) local resources for SEPs; and (3) indicators of socioeconomic inequality on SEP coverage. We define "syringe coverage" as the ratio of syringes distributed at SEPs to the number of syringes heroin injectors need in a year. We calculated the number of syringes heroin injectors need in a year by multiplying an estimate of the number of IDUs in each MSA by an estimate of the average number of times heroin injectors inject heroin per year (2.8 times per day times 365 days). In this analysis, the sample was limited to 35 MSAs in which the primary drug of choice among injectors was heroin. RESULTS: SEP coverage varies greatly across MSAs, with an average of 3 syringes distributed per 100 injection events (S.D.=0.045; range: 2 syringes per 10 injection events, to 3 syringes per 10,000 injection events). In bivariate regression analyses, a 1 unit difference in the proportion of the population that was MSM per 1000 was associated with a difference of 0.002 in SEP coverage (p=0.052); early SEP presence was associated with a difference of 0.038 in coverage (p=0.012); and having government funding was associated with a 0.040 difference in SEP coverage (p=0.021). CONCLUSIONS: This analysis suggests that longer duration of SEP presence may increase syringe distribution and enhance successful programme utilization. Furthermore, MSAs with greater proportions of MSM tend to have better SEP coverage, perhaps providing further evidence that grassroots activism plays an important role in programme implementation and successful SEP coverage. This research provides evidence that government funding for SEPs contributes to better syringe coverage.

AB  - This exploratory analysis investigates relationships of place characteristics to HIV testing among people who inject drugs (PWID). We used CDC's 2012 National HIV Behavioral Surveillance (NHBS) data among PWID from 19 US metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs); we restricted the analytic sample to PWID self-reporting being HIV negative (N = 7477). Administrative data were analyzed to describe the 1. Sociodemographic Composition; 2. Economic disadvantage; 3. Healthcare Service/Law enforcement; and 4. HIV burden of the ZIP codes, counties, and MSAs where PWID lived. Multilevel models tested associations of place characteristics with HIV testing. Fifty-eight percent of PWID reported past-year testing. MSA-level per capita correctional expenditures were positively associated with recent HIV testing among black PWID, but not white PWID. Higher MSA-level household income and imbalanced sex ratios (more women than men) in the MSA were associated with higher odds of testing. HIV screening for PWID is suboptimal (58%) and needs improvement. Identifying place characteristics associated with testing among PWID can strengthen service allocation and interventions in areas of need to increase access to HIV testing.

AB  - Community activism can be important in shaping public health policies. For example, political pressure and direct action from grassroots activists have been central to the formation of syringe exchange programs (SEPs) in the United States. We explored why SEPs are present in some localities but not others, hypothesizing that programs are unevenly distributed across geographic areas as a result of political, socioeconomic, and organizational characteristics of localities, including needs, resources, and local opposition. We examined the effects of these factors on whether SEPs were present in different US metropolitan statistical areas in 2000. Predictors of the presence of an SEP included percentage of the population with a college education, the existence of local AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP) chapters, and the percentage of men who have sex with men in the population. Need was not a predictor.

AB  - Syringe exchange programs (SEPs) aim to reduce the harm associated with injection drug use (IDU). Although they have been accepted as critical components of HIV prevention in many parts of the world, they are often unwelcome and difficult to set up and maintain, even in communities hardest hit by IDU-related HIV transmission. This research examines socio-cultural and political processes that shape community and institutional resistance toward establishing and maintaining SEPs. These processes are configured and reinforced through the socio-spatial stigmatizing of IDUs, and legal and public policy against SEPs. Overarching themes the paper considers are: (1) institutional and/or political opposition based on (a) political and law enforcement issues associated with state drug paraphernalia laws and local syringe laws; (b) harassment of drug users and resistance to services for drug users by local politicians and police; and (c) state and local government (in)action or opposition; and (2) the stigmatization of drug users and location of SEPs in local neighborhoods and business districts. Rather than be explained by "not in my back yard" localism, this pattern seems best conceptualized as an "inequitable exclusion alliance" (IEA) that institutionalizes national and local stigmatizing of drug users and other vulnerable populations.

AB  - This research presents estimates of HIV prevalence rates among injection drug users (IDUs) in large US metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) during 1992-2002. Trend data on HIV prevalence rates in geographic areas over time are important for research on determinants of changes in HIV among IDUs. Such data also provide a foundation for the design and implementation of structural interventions for preventing the spread of HIV among IDUs. Our estimates of HIV prevalence rates among IDUs in 96 US MSAs during 1992-2002 are derived from four independent sets of data: (1) research-based HIV prevalence rate estimates; (2) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Voluntary HIV Counseling and Testing data (CDC CTS); (3) data on the number of people living with AIDS compiled by the CDC (PLWAs); and (4) estimates of HIV prevalence in the US. From these, we calculated two independent sets of estimates: (1) calculating CTS-based Method (CBM) using regression adjustments to CDC CTS; and (2) calculating the PLWA-based Method (PBM) by taking the ratio of the number of injectors living with HIV to the numbers of injectors living in the MSA. We take the mean of CBM and PBM to calculate over all HIV prevalence rates for 1992-2002. We evaluated trends in IDU HIV prevalence rates by calculating estimated annual percentage changes (EAPCs) for each MSA. During 1992-2002, HIV prevalence rates declined in 85 (88.5%) of the 96 MSAs, with EAPCs ranging from -12.9% to -2.1% (mean EAPC=-6.5%; p<0.01). Across the 96 MSAs, collectively, the annual mean HIV prevalence rate declined from 11.2% in 1992 to 6.2 in 2002 (EAPC, -6.4%; p<0.01). Similarly, the median HIV prevalence rate declined from 8.1% to 4.4% (EAPC, -6.5%; p<0.01). The maximum HIV prevalence rate across the 11 years declined from 43.5% to 22.8% (EAPC, -6.7%; p<0.01). Declining HIV prevalence rates may reflect high continuing mortality among infected IDUs, as well as primary HIV prevention for non-infected IDUs and self-protection efforts by them. These results warrant further research into the population dynamics of disease progression, access to health services, and the effects of HIV prevention interventions for IDUs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: People who inject drugs (PWID) have increased risk of morbidity and mortality. We update and present estimates and trends of the prevalence of current PWID and PWID subpopulations in 96 US metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) for 1992-2007. Current estimates of PWID and PWID subpopulations will help target services and help to understand long-term health trends among PWID populations. METHODOLOGY: We calculated the number of PWID in the US annually from 1992-2007 and apportioned estimates to MSAs using multiplier methods. We used four types of data indicating drug injection to allocate national annual totals to MSAs, creating four distinct series of component estimates of PWID in each MSA and year. The four component estimates are averaged to create the best estimate of PWID for each MSA and year. We estimated PWID prevalence rates for three subpopulations defined by gender, age, and race/ethnicity. We evaluated trends using multi-level polynomial models. RESULTS: PWID per 10,000 persons aged 15-64 years varied across MSAs from 31 to 345 in 1992 (median 104.4) to 34 to 324 in 2007 (median 91.5). Trend analysis indicates that this rate declined during the early period and then was relatively stable in 2002-2007. Overall prevalence rates for non-Hispanic black PWID increased in 2005 as compared to other racial/ethnic groups. Hispanic prevalence, in contrast, declined across time. Importantly, results show a worrisome trend in young PWID prevalence since HAART was initiated--the mean prevalence was 90 to 100 per 10,000 youth in 1992-1996, but increased to >120 PWID per 10,000 youth in 2006-2007. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, PWID rates remained constant since 2002, but increased for two subpopulations: non-Hispanic black PWID and young PWID. Estimates of PWID are important for planning and evaluating public health programs to reduce harm among PWID and for understanding related trends in social and health outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adequate access to effective treatment and medication assisted therapies for opioid dependence has led to improved antiretroviral therapy adherence and decreases in morbidity among people who inject drugs (PWID), and can also address a broad range of social and public health problems. However, even with the success of syringe service programs and opioid substitution programs in European countries (and others) the US remains historically low in terms of coverage and access with regard to these programs. This manuscript investigates predictors of historical change in drug treatment coverage for PWID in 90 US metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) during 1993-2007, a period in which, overall coverage did not change. METHODS: Drug treatment coverage was measured as the number of PWID in drug treatment, as calculated by treatment entry and census data, divided by numbers of PWID in each MSA. Variables suggested by the Theory of Community Action (i.e., need, resource availability, institutional opposition, organized support, and service symbiosis) were analyzed using mixed-effects multivariate models within dependent variables lagged in time to study predictors of later change in coverage. RESULTS: Mean coverage was low in 1993 (6.7%; SD 3.7), and did not increase by 2007 (6.4%; SD 4.5). Multivariate results indicate that increases in baseline unemployment rate (β = 0.312; pseudo-p < 0.0002) predict significantly higher treatment coverage; baseline poverty rate (β = - 0.486; pseudo-p < 0.0001), and baseline size of public health and social work workforce (β = 0.425; pseudo-p < 0.0001) were predictors of later mean coverage levels, and baseline HIV prevalence among PWID predicted variation in treatment coverage trajectories over time (baseline HIV * Time: β = 0.039; pseudo-p < 0.001). Finally, increases in black/white poverty disparity from baseline predicted significantly higher treatment coverage in MSAs (β = 1.269; pseudo-p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: While harm reduction programs have historically been contested and difficult to implement in many US communities, and despite efforts to increase treatment coverage for PWID, coverage has not increased. Contrary to our hypothesis, epidemiologic need, seems not to be associated with change in treatment coverage over time. Resource availability and institutional opposition are important predictors of change over time in coverage. These findings suggest that new ways have to be found to increase drug treatment coverage in spite of economic changes and belt-tightening policy changes that will make this difficult.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Users of smokeless tobacco (chew or snuff) in the U.S. are viewed demographically as being homogeneous. Prior studies have demonstrated such homogeneity in national survey data but have not utilized latent-variable methods. The objective of this study was to determine whether a single group or underlying subgroups best characterize users of smokeless tobacco. METHODS: Men aged >17 years who had used smokeless tobacco in the past month (n=4583) were selected from the 2003, 2004, and 2005 National Surveys on Drug Use and Health. A latent-class analysis, conducted in 2008, was based on individual response patterns from six demographic variables and three items pertaining to the use of smokeless tobacco. RESULTS: Four latent classes were identified: older chew users (17.2%); younger poly-tobacco users (28.7%); skilled laborers with a high school diploma (27.5%); and educated professionals (26.6%). External validation of these classes indicated that older chew users and younger poly-tobacco users were more likely than the educated professionals to be former and current smokers, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: While users of smokeless tobacco in the U.S. are predominantly white men, they are more heterogeneous with respect to education, occupation, and residency than commonly is perceived.

AB  - This study investigated sexual identity and behavior and their potential associations with PrEP use and attitudes in cisgender Black gay and bisexual men. A total of N = 173 (mean age 25.2) participants from the Neighborhoods and Networks (N2) Study in Chicago were included. Of these, 104 were gay-identified and reported sex with men only (GSMO), 26 were gay-identified and reported sex with men and women (GSMW), 8 were bisexual-identified and reported sex with men only (BSMO), and 35 were bisexual-identified and reported sex with men and women (BSMW). Reporting sex with men and women in the past 6 months, RR = 0.39, 95% CI [0.17, 0.89], identifying as bisexual, RR = 0.52, 95% CI [0.29, 0.92], and the combination of the two, RR = 0.24, 95% CI [0.07, 0.76] were significantly associated with lower rates of current oral PrEP use. Black bisexual-identifying men who reported sex with men and women were significantly more likely to have discontinued oral PrEP, RR = 2.50, 95% CI [1.14, 5.50], than Black gay-identified men who reported sex with men only. Participants who had not used oral PrEP before reported lower levels of interest in long-acting injectable PrEP than those who were currently using oral PrEP, RR = 0.56, 95% CI [0.40, 0.79]. No other significant differences were found. Overlooking the combination of sexual identity and behavior may mischaracterize PrEP rates and miss uniquely vulnerable subgroups. Black gay and bisexual men who had not used oral PrEP may be particularly disinterested in long-acting injectable PrEP.

AB  - Galectin-3 protein is critical to the development of liver fibrosis because galectin-3 null mice have attenuated fibrosis after liver injury. Therefore, we examined the ability of novel complex carbohydrate galectin inhibitors to treat toxin-induced fibrosis and cirrhosis. Fibrosis was induced in rats by intraperitoneal injections with thioacetamide (TAA) and groups were treated with vehicle, GR-MD-02 (galactoarabino-rhamnogalaturonan) or GM-CT-01 (galactomannan). In initial experiments, 4 weeks of treatment with GR-MD-02 following completion of 8 weeks of TAA significantly reduced collagen content by almost 50% based on Sirius red staining. Rats were then exposed to more intense and longer TAA treatment, which included either GR-MD-02 or GM-CT-01 during weeks 8 through 11. TAA rats treated with vehicle developed extensive fibrosis and pathological stage 6 Ishak fibrosis, or cirrhosis. Treatment with either GR-MD-02 (90 mg/kg ip) or GM-CT-01 (180 mg/kg ip) given once weekly during weeks 8-11 led to marked reduction in fibrosis with reduction in portal and septal galectin-3 positive macrophages and reduction in portal pressure. Vehicle-treated animals had cirrhosis whereas in the treated animals the fibrosis stage was significantly reduced, with evidence of resolved or resolving cirrhosis and reduced portal inflammation and ballooning. In this model of toxin-induced liver fibrosis, treatment with two galectin protein inhibitors with different chemical compositions significantly reduced fibrosis, reversed cirrhosis, reduced galectin-3 expressing portal and septal macrophages, and reduced portal pressure. These findings suggest a potential role of these drugs in human liver fibrosis and cirrhosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Greece experienced an unprecedented increase in HIV cases among drug injectors in 2011 after economic crisis. Network-level factors are increasingly understood to drive HIV transmission in emerging epidemics. METHODS: We examined the relationship between networks, risk behaviors, and HIV serostatus among 1404 people who inject drugs in Athens, Greece. We generated networks using the chain-referral structure within a large HIV screening program. Network proportions, the proportion of a respondent's network with a given characteristic, were calculated. Multiple logistic regression models were used to assess the relationship between network proportions and individual HIV seroprevalence, injection frequency and unprotected sex. RESULTS: Of note, 1030 networks were generated. Respondent HIV seroprevalence was associated with greater proportions of network members who were HIV infected (ie, those with ≥ 50% of network members HIV positive vs. those with no network members HIV positive) (AOR: 3.11; 95% CI: 2.10 to 4.62), divided drugs (AOR: 1.60; 95% CI: 1.10 to 2.35), or injected frequently (AOR: 1.50; 95% CI: 1.02 to 2.21). Homelessness was the only sociodemographic characteristic associated with a risk outcome measure--high-frequency injecting (AOR: 1.41; 95% CI: 1.03 to 1.93). These associations were weaker for more distal second- and third-degree networks and not present when examined within random networks. CONCLUSIONS: Networks are an independently important contributor to the HIV outbreak in Athens, Greece. Network associations were strongest for the immediate network, with residual associations for distal networks. Homelessness was associated with high-frequency injecting. Prevention programs should consider including network-level interventions to prevent future emerging epidemics.

AB  - As they age, gay and bisexual men are embedded in multiple environments and communities. This article reanalyzes data collected as part of a larger qualitative study of crystal methamphetamine use in New York City. Focusing on the migration narratives of 30 racially/ethnically diverse men, age 40 years old and older, recruited from multiple venues several key areas emerged: ostracization, lack of affirmation as well as movement activities. Interactively they transformed social practices and increased spaces to explore sexuality, build community engagements and exchange resources. This study suggests that assessment of gay men (and other marginalized groups) may be enhanced through application of migration narratives.

AB  - The relationships between previous HIV counseling and testing and sexual behavior were examined among injecting drug users in Bangkok. Six hundred one i.v. drug users (IVDUs) were recruited from drug treatment programs in November of 1989. A standardized interview on AIDS risk behavior was administered and a blood sample was collected for HIV testing of the 601 people. Fifty-six percent reported that they had not been previously tested (NPT), 15% had previously tested positive (PT+), and 29% had previously tested negative (PT-). Previous testing was associated with higher levels of safer sex and contraception with primary partners: 56% of the PT+ people with regular partners reported using condoms at least some of the time with that partner, compared with 28% of the PT- and only 20% of the NPT people. Similarly, 89% of the PT+ and 72% of the PT- people, compared with 59% of the NPT people, reported practicing some form of contraception with regular partners. The results strongly support the utility of HIV counseling and testing as a method of reducing heterosexual and perinatal HIV transmission among IVDUs in Bangkok.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine factors associated with likelihood or failure to use condoms with primary sexual partners among injecting drug users (IDU) in two cities. DESIGN AND METHODS: Interviews were conducted with 601 IDU in Bangkok in 1989 and with 957 IDU in New York City in 1990-1991. Subjects were recruited from drug-use treatment programs and a research storefront. Informed consent was obtained and a World Health Organization standardized questionnaire about AIDS risk behaviors administered by a trained interviewer. RESULTS: A substantial minority (37%) of IDU in Bangkok and a majority (55%) of IDU in New York City reported penetrative intercourse (vaginal, anal or oral) with a primary partner in the 6 months before the interview. Of those reporting penetrative intercourse with a primary partner, only 12% in Bangkok and 20% in New York reported that they always used condoms. Parallel bivariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted to distinguish between subjects who reported always using condoms and subjects who reported unsafe sexual activity with primary partners. The same two factor--knowing that one is HIV-seropositive and talking about AIDS with sexual partners--were most strongly associated with always using condoms with primary partners in both cities. CONCLUSIONS: Programs to prevent sexual transmission of HIV among IDU should provide voluntary and confidential/anonymous HIV counseling and testing, and should facilitate discussions of AIDS and sexual transmission of HIV between IDU and their sexual partners. That the same two factors were associated with always using condoms with primary partners among IDU in these two cities suggests that these factors may also be important in other groups at high risk for HIV.
Trained interviewers spoke to 957 drug users attending a detoxification program, methadone maintenance program, or a research storefront in New York City in 1990-91 and to 601 drug users attending 17 drug use treatment clinics in Bangkok, Thailand, in the autumn of 1989 as part of a study to identify factors linked to the probability or failure of condom use with primary sexual partners among IV drug users. The participants also received HIV counseling and testing. IV drug users in New York City were more likely to be older (36.2 years vs. 30.1 years; p .001), female (25% vs. 5%; p .001), more ethnically diverse (p .001), and inject cocaine more often (33 injections/month vs. 0.5 injections/month) than those in Bangkok. 44% of drug users in New York City and 33% of those in Bangkok engaged in some unprotected penetrative intercourse with a primary heterosexual partner in the previous 6 months. Of drug users having penetrative sexual intercourse with a primary partner in the previous 6 months, 20% in New York City and 12% in Bangkok always used condoms (p .02). The strongest predictors of condom use among IV drug users from both countries were a previous positive HIV test and talking about AIDS with sexual partners (p = .001 for US; p = .0008 for Bangkok and p = .004 for US; p = .0596 for Bangkok, respectively). These findings indicated that unsafe sexual behavior with primary sexual partners among drug users is still a major source of HIV transmission in these 2 cities. Nevertheless, knowledge of HIV positive status and partner communication concerning AIDS are predictors of condom use shared by both groups. Thus, HIV/AIDS prevention programs should provide confidential HIV testing and counseling for drug users and should encourage frank discussions of AIDS between drug users and primary sexual partners. Peer support for risk reduction among drug users has the potential to facilitate such discussions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We studied the association between sex in exchange for money, drugs or goods and HIV for women who inject drugs (WWID) in Ukraine, as previous data on this association from the post-USSR region are contradictory. METHODS: Data come from the Integrated Bio-Behavioral Survey of Ukrainian people who inject drugs collected in 2011 using respondent-driven sampling. Participants were interviewed and tested with rapid HIV tests. RESULTS: The sample included 2465 WWID (24% HIV positive); 214 (8.7%) of which reported having had exchange sex during the last 90 days. Crude analysis showed no association between exchange sex and HIV (OR = 0.644; 95% CI 0.385-1.077). No confounders were found to alter this result in a multivariable analysis. Further modeling showed that exchange sex modifies association between HIV and alcohol use: no association between HIV and daily alcohol use was found for those women who exchanged sex (OR = 1.699, 95% CI 0.737-3.956); while not engaging in sex work and daily using alcohol reduced odds to be HIV infected (OR = 0.586, 95% CI 0.389-0.885). CONCLUSIONS: Exchange sex may have less impact on the HIV status of WWID who are exposed to injecting risks. The finding that daily alcohol use appears protective against HIV among WWID who do not exchange sex requires more research.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Although our understanding of viral transmission among people who inject drugs (PWID) has improved, we still know little about when and how many times each injector transmits HIV throughout the duration of infection. We describe HIV dynamics in PWID to evaluate which preventive strategies can be efficient. DESIGN: Due to the notably scarce interventions, HIV-1 spread explosively in Russia and Ukraine in 1990s. By studying this epidemic between 1995 and 2005, we characterized naturally occurring transmission dynamics of HIV among PWID. METHOD: We combined publicly available HIV pol and env sequences with prevalence estimates from Russia and Ukraine under an evolutionary epidemiology framework to characterize HIV transmissibility between PWID. We then constructed compartmental models to simulate HIV spread among PWID. RESULTS: In the absence of interventions, each injector transmits on average to 10 others. Half of the transmissions take place within 1 month after primary infection, suggesting that the epidemic will expand even after blocking all the post-first month transmissions. Primary prevention can realistically target the first month of infection, and we show that it is very efficient to control the spread of HIV-1 in PWID. Treating acutely infected on top of primary prevention is notably effective. CONCLUSION: As a large proportion of transmissions among PWID occur within 1 month after infection, reducing and delaying transmissions through scale-up of harm reduction programmes should always form the backbone of HIV control strategies in PWID. Growing PWID populations in the developing world, where primary prevention is scarce, constitutes a public health time bomb.

AB  - The number of public health applications for molecular epidemiology and social network analysis has increased rapidly since the improvement in computational capacities and the development of new sequencing techniques. Currently, molecular epidemiology methods are used in a variety of settings: from infectious disease surveillance systems to the description of disease transmission pathways. The latter are of great epidemiological importance as they let us describe how a virus spreads in a community, make predictions for the further epidemic developments, and plan preventive interventions. Social network methods are used to understand how infections spread through communities and what the risk factors for this are, as well as in improved contact tracing and message-dissemination interventions. Research is needed on how to combine molecular and social network data as both include essential, but not fully sufficient information on infection transmission pathways. The main differences between the two data sources are that, firstly, social network data include uninfected individuals unlike the molecular data sampled only from infected network members. Thus, social network data include more detailed picture of a network and can improve inferences made from molecular data. Secondly, network data refer to the current state and interactions within the social network, while molecular data refer to the time points when transmissions happened, which might have happened years before the sampling date. As of today, there have been attempts to combine and compare the data obtained from the two sources. Even though there is no consensus on whether and how social and genetic data complement each other, this research might significantly improve our understanding of how viruses spread through communities.

AB  - Past research suggests that as many as 50% of onward human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmissions occur during acute and recent HIV infection. It is clearly important to develop interventions which focus on this highly infectious stage of HIV infection to prevent further transmission in the risk networks of acutely and recently infected individuals. Project Protect tries to find recently and acutely infected individuals and prevents HIV transmission in their risk networks. Participants are recruited by community health outreach workers at community-based HIV testing sites and drug users' community venues, by coupon referrals and through referrals from AIDS clinics. When a network with acute/recent infection is identified, network members are interviewed about their risky behaviors, network information is collected, and blood is drawn for HIV testing. Participants are also educated and given prevention materials (condoms, syringes, educational materials); HIV-infected participants are referred to AIDS clinics and are assisted with access to care. Community alerts about elevated risk of HIV transmission are distributed within the risk networks of recently infected. Overall, 342 people were recruited to the project and screened for acute/recent HIV infection. Only six index cases of recent infection (2.3% of all people screened) were found through primary screening at voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) sites, but six cases of recent infection were found through contact tracing of these recently infected participants (7% of network members who came to the interview). Combining screening at VCT sites and contact tracing the number of recently infected people we located as compared to VCT screening alone. No adverse events were encountered. These first results provide evidence for the theory behind the intervention, i.e., in the risk networks of recently infected people there are other people with recent HIV infection and they can be successfully located without increasing stigma for project participants.

AB  - Ukraine has one of the largest HIV epidemics in Europe, historically driven by people who inject drugs (PWID). The epidemic showed signs of stabilization in 2012, but the recent war in eastern Ukraine may be reigniting virus spread. We investigated the movement of HIV-infected people within Ukraine before and during the conflict. We analyzed HIV-1 subtype-A pol nucleotide sequences sampled during 2012-2015 from 427 patients of 24 regional AIDS centers and used phylogeographic analysis to reconstruct virus movement among different locations in Ukraine. We then tested for correlations between reported PWID behaviors and reconstructed patterns of virus spread. Our analyses suggest that Donetsk and Lugansk, two cities not controlled by the Ukrainian government in eastern Ukraine, were significant exporters of the virus to the rest of the country. Additional analyses showed that viral dissemination within the country changed after 2013. Spearman correlation analysis showed that incoming virus flow was correlated with the number of HIV-infected internally displaced people. Additionally, there was a correlation between more intensive virus movement and locations with a higher proportion of PWID practicing risky sexual behaviors. Our findings suggest that effective prevention responses should involve internally displaced people and people who frequently travel to war-affected regions. Scale-up of harm reduction services for PWID will be an important factor in preventing new local HIV outbreaks in Ukraine.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, considerable effort is going into identifying and protecting those at risk. Criminalization, stigmatization and the psychological, physical, behavioural and economic consequences of substance use make people who inject drugs (PWID) extremely vulnerable to many infectious diseases. While relationships between drug use and blood-borne and sexually transmitted infections are well studied, less attention has been paid to other infectious disease outbreaks among PWID. DISCUSSION: COVID-19 is likely to disproportionally affect PWID due to a high prevalence of comorbidities that make the disease more severe, unsanitary and overcrowded living conditions, stigmatization, common incarceration, homelessness and difficulties in adhering to quarantine, social distancing or self-isolation mandates. The COVID-19 pandemic also jeopardizes essential for PWID services, such as needle exchange or substitution therapy programmes, which can be affected both in a short- and a long-term perspective. Importantly, there is substantial evidence of other infectious disease outbreaks in PWID that were associated with factors that enable COVID-19 transmission, such as poor hygiene, overcrowded living conditions and communal ways of using drugs. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 crisis might increase risks of homelessnes, overdoses and unsafe injecting and sexual practices for PWID. In order to address existing inequalities, consultations with PWID advocacy groups are vital when designing inclusive health response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Assessment of the long-term population-level effects of HIV interventions is an ongoing public health challenge. Following the implementation of a Transmission Reduction Intervention Project (TRIP) in Odessa, Ukraine, in 2013-2016, we obtained HIV pol gene sequences and used phylogenetics to identify HIV transmission clusters. We further applied the birth-death skyline model to the sequences from Odessa (n = 275) and Kyiv (n = 92) in order to estimate changes in the epidemic's effective reproductive number (R(e)) and rate of becoming uninfectious (δ). We identified 12 transmission clusters in Odessa; phylogenetic clustering was correlated with younger age and higher average viral load at the time of sampling. Estimated R(e) were similar in Odessa and Kyiv before the initiation of TRIP; R(e) started to decline in 2013 and is now below R(e) = 1 in Odessa (R(e) = 0.4, 95%HPD 0.06-0.75), but not in Kyiv (R(e) = 2.3, 95%HPD 0.2-5.4). Similarly, estimates of δ increased in Odessa after the initiation of TRIP. Given that both cities shared the same HIV prevention programs in 2013-2019, apart from TRIP, the observed changes in transmission parameters are likely attributable to the TRIP intervention. We propose that molecular epidemiology analysis can be used as a post-intervention effectiveness assessment tool.

AB  - We report on psychometric properties of a new questionnaire to study long-term strategies, practices and tactics that may help injection drug users (IDUs) avoid infection with HIV and hepatitis C. Sixty-two long-term IDUs were interviewed in New York City in 2009. Five scales based on a total of 47 items were formed covering the following domains: stigma avoidance, withdrawal prevention, homeless safety, embedding safety within a network of users, and access to resources/social support. All scales (α ≥ .79) except one (α = .61) were highly internally consistent. Seven single-item measures related to drug use reduction and injection practices were also analyzed. All variables were classified as either belonging to a group of symbiotic processes that are not directly focused upon disease prevention but nonetheless lead to risk reduction indirectly or as variables describing prevention tactics in risky situations. Symbiotic processes can be conceived of as unintentional facilitators of safe behaviors. Associations among variables offer suggestions for potential interventions. These Staying Safe variables can be used as predictors of risk behaviors and/or biological outcomes.

AB  - KLF6-SV1 (SV1), the major splice variant of KLF6, antagonizes the KLF6 tumor suppressor by an unknown mechanism. Decreased KLF6 expression in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) correlates with increased mortality, but the contribution of increased SV1 is unknown. We sought to define the impact of SV1 on human outcomes and experimental murine hepatocarcinogenesis and to elucidate its mechanism of action. In hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related HCC, an increased ratio of SV1/KLF6 within the tumor was associated with features of more advanced disease. Six months after a single injection of diethylnitrosamine (DEN), SV1 hepatocyte transgenic mice developed more histologically advanced tumors, whereas Klf6-depleted mice developed bigger tumors compared to the Klf6fl(+/+) control mice. Nine months after DEN, SV1 transgenic mice with Klf6 depletion had the greatest tumor burden. Primary mouse hepatocytes from both the SV1 transgenic animals and those with hepatocyte-specific Klf6 depletion displayed increased DNA synthesis, with an additive effect in hepatocytes harboring both SV1 overexpression and Klf6 depletion. Parallel results were obtained by viral SV1 transduction and depletion of Klf6 through adenovirus-Cre infection of primary Klf6fl(+/+) hepatocytes. Increased DNA synthesis was due to both enhanced cell proliferation and increased ploidy. Coimmunoprecipitation studies in 293T cells uncovered a direct interaction of transfected SV1 with KLF6. Accelerated KLF6 degradation in the presence of SV1 was abrogated by the proteasome inhibitor MG132. CONCLUSION: An increased SV1/KLF6 ratio correlates with more aggressive HCC. In mice, an increased SV1/KLF6 ratio, generated either by increasing SV1, decreasing KLF6, or both, accelerates hepatic carcinogenesis. Moreover, SV1 binds directly to KLF6 and accelerates its degradation. These findings represent a novel mechanism underlying the antagonism of tumor suppressor gene function by a splice variant of the same gene.

AB  - The interactions of HIV-1 Env (gp120-gp41) with CD4 and coreceptors trigger a barrage of conformational changes in Env that drive the membrane fusion process. Various regions of gp41 have profound effects on HIV entry and budding. However, the precise interactions between gp41 and the membrane have not been elucidated. To examine portions of membrane proteins that are embedded in membrane lipids, we have studied photoinduced chemical reactions in membranes using the lipid bilayer specific probe iodonaphthyl azide (INA). Here we show that in addition to the transmembrane anchor, amphipatic sequences in the cytoplasmic tail (CT) of HIV-1 gp41 are labeled by INA. INA labeling of the HIV-1 gp41 CT was similar whether wild-type or a mutant HIV-1 was used with uncleaved p55 Gag, which does not allow entry. These results shed light on the disposition of the HIV-1 gp41 CT with respect to the membrane. Moreover, our data have general implications for topology of membrane proteins and their in situ interactions with the lipid bilayer.

AB  - We describe a protocol for preparative-scale purification of the fusion protein of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), gp41, from cells overexpressing the viral envelope proteins and from HIV-1 isolates. In the first step, the proteins were extracted from the membrane in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) sample buffer. The extract was then subjected to separation by continuous elution electrophoresis using a nonionic or zwitterionic detergent in the mobile elution buffer, which results in the simultaneous exchange of SDS with that detergent. The separated proteins were obtained in an SDS-free buffer containing either Brij, 3-[(3-chloramidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS) or Triton X-100 and could then be subjected to subsequent purification steps like isoelectric focusing in the second dimension or immunoaffinity chromatography. The dilute protein fraction was concentrated and applied on a 10 mL immunoaffinity column packed with anti-gp41 monoclonal antibody immobilized on protein-G sepharose. The protein was eluted from the column at pH 2.7 and obtained in pure form in amounts of 30-50 micrograms that constituted a yield of 1%. The pure gp41 could not be sustained in solution in the absence of detergent and was not susceptible to proteolytic digestion by trypsin. The identification of the protein and the degree of purity was confirmed indirectly using surface enhanced laser desorption ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF-MS). The possible application of this approach for the isolation of integral membrane proteins with the propensity to undergo spontaneous folding and aggregation is being discussed.

AB  - Background: Photo-activation of the hydrophobic membrane probe 1, 5 iodonaphthylazide (INA) by irradiation with UV light (310-380 nm) results in the covalent modification of transmembrane anchors of membrane proteins. This unique selectivity of INA towards the transmembrane anchor has been exploited to specifically label proteins inserted in membranes. Previously, we have demonstrated that photo-activation of INA in enveloped viruses resulted in the inhibition of viral membrane protein-induced membrane fusion and viral entry into cells. In this study we show that photo-activation of INA in various cell lines, including those over-expressing the multi-drug resistance transporters MRP1 or Pgp, leads to cell death. We analyzed mechanisms of cell killing by INA-UV treatment. The effects of INA-UV treatment on signaling via various cell surface receptors, on the activity of the multi-drug resistance transporter MRP1 and on membrane protein lateral mobility were also investigated. Results: INA treatment of various cell lines followed by irradiation with UV light (310-380 nm) resulted in loss of cell viability in a dose dependent manner. The mechanism of cell death appeared to be apoptosis as indicated by phosphatidylserine exposure, mitochondrial depolarization and DNA fragmentation. Inhibition by pan-caspase inhibitors and cleavage of caspase specific substrates indicated that at low concentrations of INA apoptosis was caspase dependent. The INA-UV treatment showed similar cell killing efficacy in cells over-expressing MRP1 function as control cells. Efflux of an MRP1 substrate was blocked by INA-UV treatment of the MRP1-overexpressing cells. Although INA-UV treatment resulted in inhibition of calcium mobilization triggered by chemokine receptor signaling, Akt phosphorylation triggered by IGF1 receptor signaling was enhanced. Furthermore, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments indicated that INA-UV treatment resulted in reduced lateral mobility of a seven transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor. Conclusion: INA is a photo-activable agent that induces apoptosis in various cancer cell lines. It reacts with membrane proteins to alter the normal physiological function resulting in apoptosis. This activity of INA maybe exploited for use as an anti-cancer agent.

AB  - Although HIV uses CD4 and coreceptors (CCR5 and CXCR4) for productive infection of T cells, glycosphingolipids (GSL) may play ancillary roles in lymphoid and non-lymphoid cells. Interactions of the HIV Envelope Glycoprotein (Env) with GSL may help HIV in various steps of its pathogenesis. Physical-chemical aspects of the interactions between HIV Env and GSL leading to CD4-dependent entry into lymphocytes, the role of GSL in HIV transcytosis, and CD4-independent entry into non-lymphoid cells are reviewed. An overview of signaling properties of HIV receptors is provided with some speculation on how GSL may play a role in these events by virtue of being in membrane rafts. Finally, we summarize how interactions between HIV and coreceptors leading to signaling and/or fusion can be analyzed by the use of various tyrosine kinase and cytoskeletal inhibitors.

AB  - In this study we examined the effects of target membrane cholesterol depletion and cytoskeletal changes on human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Env-mediated membrane fusion by dye redistribution assays. We found that treatment of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MbetaCD) or cytochalasin reduced their susceptibility to membrane fusion with cells expressing HIV-1 Env that utilize CXCR4 or CCR5. However, treatment of human osteosarcoma (HOS) cells expressing high levels of CD4 and coreceptors with these agents did not affect their susceptibility to HIV-1 Env-mediated membrane fusion. Removal of cholesterol inhibited stromal cell-derived factor-1alpha- and macrophage inflammatory protein 1beta-induced chemotaxis of both PBL and HOS cells expressing CD4 and coreceptors. The fusion activity as well as the chemotactic activity of PBL was recovered by adding back cholesterol to these cells. Confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis indicated that treatment of lymphocytes with MbetaCD reduced the colocalization of CD4 or of CXCR4 with actin presumably in microvilli. These findings indicate that, although cholesterol is not required for HIV-1 Env-mediated membrane fusion per se, its depletion from cells with relatively low coreceptor densities reduces the capacity of HIV-1 Env to engage coreceptor clusters required to trigger fusion. Furthermore, our results suggest that coreceptor clustering may occur in microvilli that are supported by actin polymerization.

AB  - Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. The majority of CFTR mutations result in impaired chloride channel function as only a fraction of the mutated CFTR reaches the plasma membrane. The development of a therapeutic approach that facilitates increased cell-surface expression of CFTR could prove clinically relevant. Here, we evaluate and contrast two molecular approaches to activate CFTR expression. We find that an RNA-guided nuclease null Cas9 (dCas9) fused with a tripartite activator, VP64-p65-Rta can activate endogenous CFTR in cultured human nasal epithelial cells from CF patients. We also find that targeting BGas, a long non-coding RNA involved in transcriptionally modulating CFTR expression with a gapmer, induced both strong knockdown of BGas and concordant activation of CFTR. Notably, the gapmer can be delivered to target cells when generated as electrostatic particles with recombinant HIV-Tat cell penetrating peptide (CPP), when packaged into exosomes, or when loaded into lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). Treatment of patient-derived human nasal epithelial cells containing F508del with gapmer-CPP, gapmer-exosomes, or LNPs resulted in increased expression and function of CFTR. Collectively, these observations suggest that CRISPR/dCas-VPR (CRISPR) and BGas-gapmer approaches can target and specifically activate CFTR.

AB  - The legal environment is one factor that influences injection drug users' (IDUs) risk for HIV and other bloodborne pathogens such as hepatitis C virus (HCV). We examined the association between law enforcement encounters (i.e., arrests and citations) and receptive syringe sharing among IDUs in the context of an intensified policing effort. We conducted a mixed methods analysis of 30 qualitative and 187 quantitative interviews with IDUs accessing services at a Los Angeles, CA syringe exchange program from 2008 to 2009. Qualitative findings illustrate concerns related to visibility, drug withdrawal, and previous history of arrest/incarceration. In quantitative analysis, the number of citations received, current homelessness, and perceiving that being arrested would be a "big problem" were independently associated with recent syringe sharing. Findings illustrate some of the unintended public health consequences associated with intensified street-level policing, including risk for HIV and HCV transmission.

AB  - Injection drug users (IDUs) are at risk for HIV and viral hepatitis, and risky injection behavior persists despite decades of intervention. Cognitive behavioral theories (CBTs) are commonly used to help understand risky injection behavior. The authors review findings from CBT-based studies of injection risk behavior among IDUs. An extensive literature search was conducted in spring 2007. In total, 33 studies were reviewed- 26 epidemiological and 7 intervention studies. Findings suggest that some theoretical constructs have received fairly consistent support (e.g., self-efficacy, social norms), whereas others have yielded inconsistent or null results (e.g., perceived susceptibility, knowledge, behavioral intentions, perceived barriers, perceived benefits, response efficacy, perceived severity). The authors offer some possible explanations for these inconsistent findings, including differences in theoretical constructs and measures across studies and a need to examine the environmental structures that influence risky behaviors. Greater integration of CBT with a risk environment perspective may yield more conclusive findings and more effective interventions in the future.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Drug overdose rates in the United States have been steadily increasing, particularly in rural areas. The COVID-19 pandemic and associated mitigation strategies may have increased overdose risk for people who use drugs by impacting social, community, and structural factors. METHODS: The study included a quantitative survey focused on COVID-19 administered to 50 people who use drugs and semi-structured qualitative interviews with 17 people who use drugs, 12 of whom also participated in the quantitative survey. Descriptive statistics were run for the quantitative data. Qualitative coding was line-by-line then grouped thematically. Quantitative and qualitative data were integrated during analysis. RESULTS: Findings demonstrate how COVID-19 disruptions at the structural and community level affected outcomes related to mental health and drug use at the individual level. Themes that emerged from the qualitative interviews were (1) lack of employment opportunities, (2) food and housing insecurity, (3) community stigma impacting health service use, (4) mental health strains, and (5) drug market disruptions. Structural and community changes increased anxiety, depression, and loneliness on the individual level, as well as changes in drug use patterns, all of which are likely to increase overdose risk. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic, and mitigation strategies aimed at curbing infection, disrupted communities and lives of people who use drugs. These disruptions altered individual drug use and mental health outcomes, which could increase risk for overdose. We recommend addressing structural and community factors, including developing multi-level interventions, to combat overdose. Trial registration Clinicaltrails.gov: NCT04427202.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Overdose is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among people who inject drugs. Illicitly manufactured fentanyl is now a major driver of opioid overdose deaths. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 23 participants (19 persons who inject drugs and 4 service providers) from rural southern Illinois. Data were analyzed using constant comparison and theoretical sampling methods. RESULTS: Participants were concerned about the growing presence of fentanyl in both opioids and stimulants, and many disclosed overdose experiences. Strategies participants reported using to lower overdose risk included purchasing drugs from trusted sellers and modifying drug use practices by partially injecting and/or changing the route of transmission. Approximately half of persons who inject drugs sampled had heard of fentanyl test strips, however fentanyl test strip use was low. To reverse overdoses, participants reported using cold water baths. Use of naloxone to reverse overdose was low. Barriers to naloxone access and use included fear of arrest and opioid withdrawal. CONCLUSIONS: People who inject drugs understood fentanyl to be a potential contaminant in their drug supply and actively engaged in harm reduction techniques to try to prevent overdose. Interventions to increase harm reduction education and information about and access to fentanyl test strips and naloxone would be beneficial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has increased among persons who inject drugs (PWID) in the United States with disproportionate burden in rural areas. We use the Risk Environment framework to explore potential economic, physical, social, and political determinants of hepatitis C in rural southern Illinois. METHODS: Nineteen in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with PWID from August 2019 through February 2020 (i.e., pre-COVID-19 pandemic) and four with key informants who professionally worked with PWID. Interviews were recorded, professionally transcribed, and coded using qualitative software. We followed a grounded theory approach for coding and analyses. RESULTS: We identify economic, physical, policy, and social factors that may influence HCV transmission risk and serve as barriers to HCV care. Economic instability and lack of economic opportunities, a lack of physically available HCV prevention and treatment services, structural stigma such as policies that criminalize drug use, and social stigma emerged in interviews as potential risks for transmission and barriers to care. CONCLUSION: The rural risk environment framework acknowledges the importance of community and structural factors that influence HCV infection and other disease transmission and care. We find that larger structural factors produce vulnerabilities and reduce access to resources, which negatively impact hepatitis C disease outcomes.

AB  - Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a medication that prevents HIV acquisition, yet PrEP uptake has been low among people who inject drugs. Stigma has been identified as a fundamental driver of population health and may be a significant barrier to PrEP care engagement among PWID. However, there has been limited research on how stigma operates in rural and urban settings in relation to PrEP. Using in-depth semi-structured qualitative interviews (n = 57) we explore PrEP continuum engagement among people actively injecting drugs in rural and urban settings. Urban participants had more awareness and knowledge. Willingness to use PrEP was similar in both settings. However, no participant was currently using PrEP. Stigmas against drug use, HIV, and sexualities were identified as barriers to PrEP uptake, particularly in the rural setting. Syringe service programs in the urban setting were highlighted as a welcoming space where PWID could socialize and therefore mitigate stigma and foster information sharing.

AB  - Men who inject drugs (MWID) and engage in transactional sex (i.e., receive money or drugs in exchange for sex) are vulnerable to HIV and violence. However, MWID who engage in transactional sex have been less studied than women. We examine factors associated with transactional sex among MWID in Los Angeles and San Francisco and whether transactional sex is associated with violent victimization. MWID were recruited using targeted sampling methods in 2011-2013 and completed surveys that covered demographics, drug use, HIV risk, violence, transactional sex, and other items. Multivariable logistic regression was used to (1) determine factors independently associated with transactional sex and (2) determine if transactional sex was independently associated with violence victimization in the last 6 months among MWID. An interaction term between income source and sexual identity was included in the transactional sex model. Of the 572 male PWID in the sample, 47 (8%) reported transactional sex in the past 6 months. Self-reported HIV infection was 7% for MWID who did not report transactional sex, 17% for MWID who reported transactional sex, and 24% for MWID who reported transactional sex and reported gay or bisexual identity. In multivariable analysis, transactional sex was positively associated with gay or bisexual identity (GB without illegal income adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 5.16; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.86-14.27; GB with illegal income AOR = 13.55, CI = 4.57-40.13), coerced sex in the last 12 months (AOR = 11.66, CI = 1.94-70.12), and violent victimization in the last 12 months (AOR = 2.31, CI = 1.13-4.75). Transactional sex was negatively associated with heroin injection (last 30 days) (AOR = 0.37; 95% CI = 0.18-0.78). Transactional sex was independently associated with violent victimization in the last 12 months (AOR = 2.04; 95% CI = 1.00-4.14) while controlling for confounders. MWID who engaged in transactional sex are at elevated risk for HIV and multiple forms of violent victimization. Interventions focused on this at-risk subpopulation are urgently needed and should include access to substance use disorder treatment, victimization services, and harm reduction services across the HIV care continuum.

AB  - Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention is indicated for people who inject drugs (PWID), yet most studies do not focus on PWID. This study examines factors associated with PrEP awareness and willingness, and identifies perceived barriers to PrEP among PWID. Methods: PWID were interviewed in Los Angeles and San Francisco, CA from 2016 to 2018. We analyzed data from self-reported HIV-negative participants who had injected drugs within the past 6 months (n = 469). Questions on PrEP included awareness, willingness, barriers, and uptake. Multiple logistic regression models of factors associated with awareness of, and willingness to, take PrEP were developed. Descriptive statistics on perceived PrEP barriers are reported. Results: Among HIV-negative PWID, 40% were aware of PrEP, 59% reported willingness to take PrEP, and 2% were currently taking PrEP. In multivariable analysis, PrEP awareness was associated with study site and sexual minority status, higher educational attainment, and HIV testing in the last 6 months. Willingness to take PrEP was associated with self-reported risk (paying sex partner in the last 6 months, sharing drug paraphernalia, and being injected by another PWID) and perceived HIV risk. The most common perceived barriers to PrEP were copays, concerns about increased HIV or sexually transmitted risk with PrEP, and concerns about reduction of medication efficacy without daily use. Conclusion: PrEP awareness among PWID remains inadequate. Willingness to take PrEP was moderate and was most desired by PWID who engaged in high-risk behaviors. Interventions to increase PrEP awareness and willingness, and to facilitate PrEP uptake among PWID are needed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Opioid overdose rates have steadily been increasing in the United States (US) creating what is considered an overdose death crisis. The US has a mixture of public health and punitive policies aimed to address opioid use and the overdose crisis, yet little is known about public opinion relating to opioid use and policy support. Understanding the intersection of public opinion about opioid use disorder (OUD) and policy can be useful for developing interventions to address policy responses to overdose deaths. METHODS: A national sample of cross-sectional data from the AmeriSpeak survey conducted from 27 February 2020 through 2 March 2020 was analyzed. Measures included attitudes toward OUD and policy beliefs. Latent class analysis, a person-centered approach, was used to identify groups of individuals endorsing similar stigma and policy beliefs. We then examined the relationship between the identified groups (i.e., classes) and key behavioral and demographic factors. RESULTS: We identified three distinct groups: (1) "High Stigma/High Punitive Policy", (2) "High Stigma/Mixed Public Health and Punitive Policy", and (3) "Low Stigma/High Public Health Policy". People with higher levels of education had reduced odds of being in the "High Stigma/High Punitive Policy" group. CONCLUSION: Public health policies are most effective in addressing OUD. We suggest targeting interventions toward the "High Stigma/Mixed Public Health and Punitive Policy" group since this group already displays some support for public health policies. Broader interventions, such as eliminating stigmatizing messaging in the media and redacting punitive policies, could reduce OUD stigma among all groups.

AB  - As an approach to clarifying the molecular basis of pain and fatigue in muscles involved in temporomandibular disorders, we examined the activity of histidine decarboxylase (HDC), the enzyme which forms histamine, in the masseter muscles of mice. In the resting muscle, HDC activity was very low. Direct electrical stimulation of the muscle markedly elevated HDC activity. HDC activity rose within 3 hrs of the electrical stimulation, peaked at 6 to 8 hrs, and then gradually declined. Intraperitoneal injection of a small amount of interleukin-1 (IL-1) (from 1 to 10 microg/kg) produced a similar elevation of HDC activity in the masseter muscle. We also examined the effect of an antihistamine, chlorphenylamine (CP), on temporomandibular disorders in humans and compared it with that of an anti-inflammatory analgesic, flurbiprofen (FB). Two groups received one or the other of the drugs daily for 7 days, and they were asked about their signs and symptoms before and after the treatment. A positive evaluation of their treatment was made by 74% of the CP group, but by only 48% of the FB group. Although the effects of CP on the limitation of mouth-opening and on joint noise were negligible, about 50% of the CP group answered positively concerning the drug's effect on spontaneous pain or pain induced by chewing or mouth-opening. The positive evaluation for CP (50%) in relieving associated symptoms (headache or shoulder stiffness) was significantly greater than for FB (13%). FB showed effectiveness similar to but sometimes weaker than that of CP on several symptoms. On the basis of these and previous results and the known actions of histamine, we propose that the histamine newly formed following the induction of HDC activity, which is itself mediated by IL-1, may be involved in inducing pain and, possibly, stiffness in muscles in temporomandibular disorders.

AB  - Visual culture deeply influences those whom pastoral care providers serve, and contemporary practices with images complicate images' contribution to personal or social suffering. I begin by describing the mobile, networked dynamics of contemporary visual practices, which include receiving but also creating, curating, and sharing images in emergent and shifting visual communities. I then utilize visual studies theorist Gary Shapiro's concept of visual regimes, outlining how images work as a kind of soft power that influences the social construction of meaning. I illustrate these practices through a selection of images surrounding the police shooting of Michael Brown by officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri, and the protests and online debates that arose from that tragic event. I suggest throughout this paper that images play a major part in the social construction of subjective worlds and thus contribute both to our suffering and to the meaning we make from our suffering.

AB  - This study examined the perceived motivations and consequences of voluntary disclosure of Facebook active users using a survey administered to college students in a public-speaking course. College-age students who took the survey were motivated to use Facebook because they perceived their relationships improved with friends and family, although using Facebook could become negatively habit forming. The research suggests that users of Facebook use it more for disclosing to distant friends rather than to close friends, which is divergent from most early disclosure research that equates disclosure with intimacy. This research utilizes Communication Privacy Management Theory for the theoretical framework.

AB  - Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a beta-herpesvirus carried by;80% of the world's population. Acute infections are asymptomatic in healthy individuals but generate diverse syndromes in neonates, solid organ transplant recipients, and HIV-infected individuals. The HCMV gene US28 encodes a homolog of a human chemokine receptor that is able to bind several chemokines and HIV gp120. Deep sequencing technologies were used to sequence US28 directly from 60 clinical samples from Indonesian HIV patients and Australian renal transplant recipients, healthy adults, and neonates. Molecular modeling approaches were used to predict whether nine nonsynonymous mutations in US28 may alter protein binding to a panel of six chemokines and two variants of HIV gp120. Ninety-two percent of samples contained more than one variant of HCMV, as defined by at least one nonsynonymous mutation. Carriage of these variants differed between neonates and adults, Australian and Indonesian samples, and saliva samples and blood leukocytes. Two nonsynonymous mutations (N170D and R267K) were associated with increased levels of immediate early protein 1 (IE-1) and glycoprotein B (gB) HCMV-reactive antibodies, suggesting a higher viral burden. Seven of the nine mutations were predicted to alter binding of at least one ligand. Overall, HCMV variants are common in all populations and have the potential to affect US28 interactions with human chemokines and/or gp120 and alter responses to the virus. The findings relied on deep sequencing technologies applied directly to clinical samples, so the variants exist in vivo. IMPORTANCE Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a common viral pathogen of solid organ transplant recipients, neonates, and HIV-infected individuals. HCMV encodes homologs of several host genes with the potential to influence viral persistence and/ or pathogenesis. Here, we present deep sequencing of an HCMV chemokine receptor homolog, US28, acquired directly from clinical specimens. Carriage of these variants differed between patient groups and was associated with different levels of circulating HCMV-reactive antibodies. These features are consistent with a role for US28 in HCMV persistence and pathogenesis. This was supported by in silico analyses of the variant sequences demonstrating altered ligand-binding profiles. The data delineate a novel approach to understanding the pathogenesis of HCMV and may impact the development of an effective vaccine.

AB  - Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is carried lifelong by similar to 80 % of adults worldwide, generating distinct disease syndromes in transplant recipients, people with HIV (PWH) and neonates. Amino acids 15-23 encoded by the HCMV gene UL40 match positions 3-11 of HLA-A and HLA-C, and constitute a "signal peptide" able to stabilise cell surface HLA-E as a restriction element and a ligand of NKG2A and NKG2C. We present next generation sequencing of UL40 amplified from 15 Australian renal transplant recipients (RTR), six healthy adults and four neonates, and 21 Indonesian PWH. We found no groupwise associations between the presence of multiple sequences and HCMV burden (highest in PWH) or HCMV-associated symptoms in neonates. Homology between UL40 and corresponding HLA-C and HLA-A peptides in 11 RTR revealed perfect matches with HLA-C in three individuals, all carrying HCMV encoding only VMAPRTLIL - a peptide previously associated with viremia. However indices of the burden of HCMV did not segregate in our cohort.

AB  - Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a beta-herpesvirus. Latent infections are common in all populations. However age associated increases in levels of CMV-reactive antibody are testament to repeated reactivations and periods of viral replication. CMV has been associated with several diseases of aging, including vasculopathy and neurocognitive impairment. These conditions occur at a younger age in persons with particularly high burdens of CMV - transplant recipients and people living with HIV. Here we define the "clinical footprints" as immunopathologies triggered by CMV that develop over many years. A high burden of CMV also drives accumulation of multifunctional terminally-differentiated alpha beta T-cells, a novel population of V delta 2(-) gamma delta T-cells, and a population of CD56(10) NI( cells lacking a key regulatory molecule. An understanding of these "immunological footprints" of CMV may reveal how they collectively promote the "clinical footprints" of the virus. This is explored here in transplant recipients, HIV patients and healthy aging. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a beta-herpesvirus carried by -80% of adults worldwide. Acute infections are often asymptomatic in healthy individuals but generate diverse syndromes in neonates, renal transplant recipients (RTR), and people with HIV (PWH). The HCMV gene UL111a encodes a homolog of human interleukin-10 (IL-10) that interacts with the human IL-10 receptor. Deep sequencing technologies were used to sequence UL111a directly from 59 clinical samples from Indonesian PWH and Australian RTR, healthy adults, and neonates. Overall, 93% of samples contained more than one variant of HCMV, as defined by at least one nonsynonymous variation. Carriage of these variants differed between neonates and adults, Australians and Indonesians, and between saliva and blood leukocytes. The variant alleles of N41D and S71Y occurred together in Australian RTR and were associated with higher T-cell responses to HCMV pp65. The variant P122S was associated with lower levels of antibodies reactive with a lysate of HCMV-infected fibroblasts. L174F was associated with increased levels of antibodies reactive with HCMV lysate, immediate-early 1 (IE-1), and glycoprotein B (gB) in Australian RTR and Indonesians PWH, suggesting a higher viral burden. We conclude that variants of UL111a are common in all populations and may influence systemic responses to HCMV.

AB  - Around 80% of adults worldwide carry human cytomegaloviris (HCMV). The HCMV gene UL18 is a homolog of HLA class I genes and encodes a protein with high affinity for the NK and T-cell cytotoxicity inhibitor LIR-1. UL18 was deep sequenced from blood, saliva or urine from Indonesian people with HIV (PWH) (n = 28), Australian renal transplant recipients (RTR) (n = 21), healthy adults (n = 7) and neonates (n = 4). 95% of samples contained more than one variant of HCMV UL18, as defined by carriage of nonsynonymous variations. When aligned with immunological markers of the host's burden of HCMV, the S318N variation associated with high levels of antibody reactive with HCMV lysate in PWH over 12 months on antiretroviral therapy. The A107T variation associated with HCMV antibody levels and inflammatory biomarkers in PWH at early timepoints. Variants D32G, D248N, V250A and E252D aligned with elevated HCMV antibody levels in RTR, while M191K, E196Q and F165L were associated with HCMV-reactive T-cells and proportions of V delta 2(-) gamma delta T-cells-populations linked with high burdens of HCMV. We conclude that UL18 is a highly variable gene, where variation may alter the persistent burden of HCMV and/or the host response to that burden.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The relative efficacy and safety of intravitreous aflibercept, bevacizumab, and ranibizumab in the treatment of diabetic macular edema are unknown. METHODS: At 89 clinical sites, we randomly assigned 660 adults (mean age, 61±10 years) with diabetic macular edema involving the macular center to receive intravitreous aflibercept at a dose of 2.0 mg (224 participants), bevacizumab at a dose of 1.25 mg (218 participants), or ranibizumab at a dose of 0.3 mg (218 participants). The study drugs were administered as often as every 4 weeks, according to a protocol-specified algorithm. The primary outcome was the mean change in visual acuity at 1 year. RESULTS: From baseline to 1 year, the mean visual-acuity letter score (range, 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better visual acuity; a score of 85 is approximately 20/20) improved by 13.3 with aflibercept, by 9.7 with bevacizumab, and by 11.2 with ranibizumab. Although the improvement was greater with aflibercept than with the other two drugs (P<0.001 for aflibercept vs. bevacizumab and P=0.03 for aflibercept vs. ranibizumab), it was not clinically meaningful, because the difference was driven by the eyes with worse visual acuity at baseline (P<0.001 for interaction). When the initial visual-acuity letter score was 78 to 69 (equivalent to approximately 20/32 to 20/40) (51% of participants), the mean improvement was 8.0 with aflibercept, 7.5 with bevacizumab, and 8.3 with ranibizumab (P>0.50 for each pairwise comparison). When the initial letter score was less than 69 (approximately 20/50 or worse), the mean improvement was 18.9 with aflibercept, 11.8 with bevacizumab, and 14.2 with ranibizumab (P<0.001 for aflibercept vs. bevacizumab, P=0.003 for aflibercept vs. ranibizumab, and P=0.21 for ranibizumab vs. bevacizumab). There were no significant differences among the study groups in the rates of serious adverse events (P=0.40), hospitalization (P=0.51), death (P=0.72), or major cardiovascular events (P=0.56). CONCLUSIONS: Intravitreous aflibercept, bevacizumab, or ranibizumab improved vision in eyes with center-involved diabetic macular edema, but the relative effect depended on baseline visual acuity. When the initial visual-acuity loss was mild, there were no apparent differences, on average, among study groups. At worse levels of initial visual acuity, aflibercept was more effective at improving vision. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01627249.).

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Comparisons of the relative effect of 3 anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents to treat diabetic macular edema warrant further assessment. OBJECTIVE: To provide additional outcomes from a randomized trial evaluating 3 anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents for diabetic macular edema within subgroups based on baseline visual acuity (VA) and central subfield thickness (CST) as evaluated on optical coherence tomography. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Post hoc exploratory analyses were conducted of randomized trial data on 660 adults with diabetic macular edema and decreased VA (Snellen equivalent, approximately 20/32 to 20/320). The original study was conducted between August 22, 2012, and August 28, 2013. Analysis was conducted from January 7 to June 2, 2015. INTERVENTIONS: Repeated 0.05-mL intravitreous injections of 2.0 mg of aflibercept (224 eyes), 1.25 mg of bevacizumab (218 eyes), or 0.3 mg of ranibizumab (218 eyes) as needed per protocol. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: One-year VA and CST outcomes within prespecified subgroups based on both baseline VA and CST thresholds, defined as worse (20/50 or worse) or better (20/32 to 20/40) VA and thicker (≥400 µm) or thinner (250 to 399 µm) CST. RESULTS: In the subgroup with worse baseline VA (n = 305), irrespective of baseline CST, aflibercept showed greater improvement than bevacizumab or ranibizumab for several VA outcomes. In the subgroup with better VA and thinner CST at baseline (61-73 eyes across 3 treatment groups), VA outcomes showed little difference between groups; mean change was +7.2, +8.4, and +7.6 letters in the aflibercept, bevacizumab, and ranibizumab groups, respectively. However, in the subgroup with better VA and thicker CST at baseline (31-43 eyes), there was a suggestion of worse VA outcomes in the bevacizumab group; mean change from baseline to 1 year was +9.5, +5.4, and +9.5 letters in the aflibercept, bevacizumab, and ranibizumab groups, respectively, and VA letter score was greater than 84 (approximately 20/20) in 21 of 33 (64%), 7 of 31 (23%), and 21 of 43 (49%) eyes, respectively. The adjusted differences and 95% CIs were 39% (17% to 60%) for aflibercept vs bevacizumab, 25% (5% to 46%) for ranibizumab vs bevacizumab, and 13% (-8% to 35%) for aflibercept vs ranibizumab. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These post hoc secondary findings suggest that for eyes with better initial VA and thicker CST, some VA outcomes may be worse in the bevacizumab group than in the aflibercept and ranibizumab groups. Given the exploratory nature of these analyses and the small sample size within subgroups, caution is suggested when using the data to guide treatment considerations for patients.

AB  - PURPOSE: We estimated female and male incident AIDS diagnosis rates (IARs) among people who inject drugs (PWID) in U.S. metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) over time to assess whether declines in IARs varied by sex after combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) dissemination. METHODS: We compared IARs and 95% confidence intervals for female and male PWID in 95 of the most populous MSAs. To stabilize estimates, we aggregated data across three-year periods, selecting a period immediately preceding cART (1993-1995) and the most recent after the introduction of cART for which data were available (2005-2007). We assessed disparities by comparing IAR 95% confidence intervals for overlap, female-to-male risk ratios, and disparity change scores. RESULTS: IARs declined an average of 58% for female PWID and 67% for male PWID between the pre-cART and cART periods. Among female PWID, IARs were significantly lower in the later period relative to the pre-cART period in 48% of MSAs. Among male PWID, IARs were significantly lower over time in 86% of MSAs. CONCLUSIONS: IARs among female PWID in large U.S. MSAs have declined more slowly than among male PWID. This suggests a need for increased targeting of prevention and treatment programs and for research on MSA level conditions that may drive differences in declining AIDS rates among female and male PWID.

AB  - The interactions between the N- and C-terminal heptad repeat (NHR and CHR) regions of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) glycoprotein gp41 create a structure comprising a 6-helix bundle (SHB). A sequence in the SHB named the "pocket" is crucial for the SHB's stability and for the fusion inhibitory activity of 36-residue NHR peptide N36. We report that a short 27-residue peptide, N27, which lacks the pocket sequence, exhibits potent inhibitory activity in both cell-cell and virus-cell fusion assays when fatty acids were conjugated to its N but not C terminus. Furthermore, mutations in the positions that prevent interaction with the CHR but not with the NHR resulted in a dramatic reduction in N27 activity. These data support a mechanism in which N27 mainly targets the CHR rather than the internal NHR coiled-coil, reveal the N-terminal edge of the endogenous core structure in situ and hence complement our recent findings of the C-terminal edge of the core, and provide a new approach for designing short inhibitors from the NHR region of other lentiviruses due to similarities in their envelope proteins.

AB  - Human immunodeficiency virus 1 gp41 folds into a six-helix bundle whereby three C-terminal heptad repeat regions pack in an anti-parallel manner against the coiled-coil formed by three N-terminal heptad repeats (NHR). Peptides that inhibit bundle formation contributed significantly to the understanding of the entry mechanism of the virus. DP178, which partially overlaps C-terminal heptad repeats, prevents bundle formation through an undefined mechanism; additionally it has been suggested to bind other ENV regions and arrest fusion in an unknown manner. We used two structurally altered DP178 peptides; in each, two sequential amino acids were substituted into their d configuration, d-SQ in the hydrophilic N-terminal region and d-LW in the hydrophobic C-terminal. Importantly, we generated an elongated NHR peptide, N54, obtaining the full N-helix docking site for DP178. Interestingly, d-LW retained wild type fusion inhibitory activity, whereas d-SQ exhibited significantly reduced activity. In correlation with the inhibitory data, CD spectroscopy and fluorescence studies revealed that all the DP178 peptides interact with N54, albeit with different stabilities of the bundles. We conclude that strong binding of DP178 N-terminal region to the endogenous NHR, without significant contribution of the C-terminal sequence of DP178 to core formation, is vital for DP178 inhibition. The finding that d-amino acid incorporation in the C terminus did not affect activity or membrane binding as revealed by surface plasmon resonance correlates with an additional membrane binding site, or membrane anchoring role, for the C terminus, which works synergistically with the N terminus to inhibit fusion.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Despite advances in our knowledge of effective services for people who use drugs over the last decades globally, coverage remains poor in most countries, while quality is often unknown. This paper aims to discuss the historical development of successful epidemiological indicators and to present a framework for extending them with additional indicators of coverage and quality of harm reduction services, for monitoring and evaluation at international, national or subnational levels. The ultimate aim is to improve these services in order to reduce health and social problems among people who use drugs, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, crime and legal problems, overdose (death) and other morbidity and mortality. METHODS AND RESULTS: The framework was developed collaboratively using consensus methods involving nominal group meetings, review of existing quality standards, repeated email commenting rounds and qualitative analysis of opinions/experiences from a broad range of professionals/experts, including members of civil society and organisations representing people who use drugs. Twelve priority candidate indicators are proposed for opioid agonist therapy (OAT), needle and syringe programmes (NSP) and generic cross-cutting aspects of harm reduction (and potentially other drug) services. Under the specific OAT indicators, priority indicators included 'coverage', 'waiting list time', 'dosage' and 'availability in prisons'. For the specific NSP indicators, the priority indicators included 'coverage', 'number of needles/syringes distributed/collected', 'provision of other drug use paraphernalia' and 'availability in prisons'. Among the generic or cross-cutting indicators the priority indicators were 'infectious diseases counselling and care', 'take away naloxone', 'information on safe use/sex' and 'condoms'. We discuss conditions for the successful development of the suggested indicators and constraints (e.g. funding, ideology). We propose conducting a pilot study to test the feasibility and applicability of the proposed indicators before their scaling up and routine implementation, to evaluate their effectiveness in comparing service coverage and quality across countries. CONCLUSIONS: The establishment of an improved set of validated and internationally agreed upon best practice indicators for monitoring harm reduction service will provide a structural basis for public health and epidemiological studies and support evidence and human rights-based health policies, services and interventions.

AB  - Intra-anal malignancies disproportionately affect individuals who engage in anal intercourse because of infection with human papillomaviruses (HPVs), with an increased risk attributed to infection with HIV because of a declining immunity against HPVs. Long-term persistence of HPVs suggests yet other mechanisms that determine the clinical outcome, however. Because methylation of HPV DNA represses oncogene expression in cervical samples, we investigated whether this mechanism also occurs in HIV-positive men and studied the methylation of CpG dinucleotides overlapping with the HPV-16 enhancer and promoter in 16 anal samples. Similar to cervical infections, the average methylation frequency was 12.3%, with heterogeneities between clones from different and the same samples. In low-grade anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN), methylation was high in CpGs overlapping the viral enhancer but rare in promoter positions, whereas methylation was high in promoter regions in high-grade AIN, especially in samples with a high load of viral genomes. The viral replication origin was never methylated. We also detected de novo methylation at methylated (me) CpA, meCpT, and meCpC dinucleotides. Our study expands the observation and mapping of HPV DNA methylation to anal infections and the HIV-positive patient population. As observed at the cervix, DNA methylation may force HPVs into latency with functional replication but repressed transcription. Escape from this repression is a prerequisite for neoplastic progression; however, methylation resumes because of chromosomal integration of HPV genomes but spares some HPV genomes in each cell that maintain the transformed phenotype. DNA methylation, taken together with virus load, may be useful to diagnose the emergence of a population of tumor cells.

AB  - Experiences of coerced or forced sex have been associated with risk for HIV infection for all adults and may be more common for gays, lesbians, bisexuals (GLB) and people who inject drugs (PWID). In this study, we explored factors associated with prior 12-month experiences of forced or coerced sex among a sample of PWID, with a focus on sexual orientation and gender. PWID (N = 772) from Los Angeles and San Francisco were recruited using targeted sampling methods in 2011-2013 and surveyed on a range of items related to demographics, drug use, HIV risk, and violence, including experiences of forced or coerced sex in the prior 12 months. In this racially/ethnically diverse, mostly homeless, and low-income sample of PWID, 25% of participants were female and 15% identified as GLB. Sexual coercion was reported by 9% of gay and bisexual men, 8% of heterosexual females, 5% of lesbians and bisexual women, and less than 1% of heterosexual men. In multivariate analyses, compared to heterosexual males, gay or bisexual males (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 10.68; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.03, 56.23), and heterosexual females (AOR = 9.69; 95% CI = 2.04, 45.94) had increased odds of coerced sex in the prior 12 months. Having a paying sex partner (AOR = 3.49; 95% CI = 1.42, 8.54) or having had forced sex prior to the age of 16 by someone at least five years older (AOR = 4.74; 95% CI = 1.88, 11.93) also elevated the odds of coercive sex. Sexual coercion is common among PWID, but especially for gay and bisexual men and heterosexual females. Efforts to reduce sexual violence among PWID are urgently needed.

AB  - PURPOSE: After years of stable or declining HIV prevalence and declining incidence among people who inject drugs (PWID) in the United States, some rapidly emerging outbreaks have recently occurred in new areas (e.g., Scott County, Indiana). However, to our knowledge, trends over time in HIV prevalence among PWID in US metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) across all major regions of the country have not been systematically estimated beyond 2002, and the extent to which HIV prevalence may be increasing in other areas is largely unknown. This article estimates HIV prevalence among PWID in 89 of the most populated US MSAs, both overall and by geographic region, using more recent surveillance and HIV testing data. METHODS: We computed MSA-specific annual estimates of HIV prevalence (both diagnosed and undiagnosed infections) among PWID for these 89 MSAs, for 1992-2013, using several data series from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National HIV Surveillance System and National HIV Prevention Monitoring and Evaluation data; Holmberg's (1997) estimates of 1992 PWID population size and of HIV prevalence and incidence among PWID; and research estimates from published literature using 1992-2013 data. A mixed effects model, with time nested within MSAs, was used to regress the literature review estimates on all of the other data series. Multiple imputation was used to address missing data. Resulting estimates were validated using previous 1992-2002 estimates of HIV prevalence and data on antiretroviral (ARV) prescription volumes and examined for patterns based on geographic region, numbers of people tested for HIV, and baseline HIV prevalence. RESULTS: Mean (across all MSAs) trends over time suggested decreases through 2002 (from approximately 11.4% in 1992 to 9.2% in 2002), followed by a period of stability, and steep increases after 2010 (to 10.6% in 2013). Validation analyses found a moderate positive correlation between our estimates and ARV prescription volumes (r = 0.45), and a very strong positive correlation (r = 0.94) between our estimates and previous estimates by Tempalski et al. (2009) for 1992-2002 (which used different methods). Analysis by region and baseline prevalence suggested that mean increases in later years were largely driven by MSAs in the Western United States and by MSAs in the Midwest that had low baseline prevalence. Our estimates suggest that prevalence decreased across all years in the Eastern United States. These trends were particularly clear when MSAs with very low numbers of people tested for HIV were removed from analyses to reduce unexplained variability in mean trajectories. CONCLUSIONS: Our estimates suggest a fairly large degree of variation in 1992-2013 trajectories of PWID HIV prevalence among 89 US MSAs, particularly by geographic region. They suggest that public health responses in many MSAs (particularly those with larger HIV prevalence among PWID in the early 1990s) were sufficient to decrease or maintain HIV prevalence over time. However, future research should investigate potential factors driving the estimated increase in prevalence after 2002 MSAs in the West and Midwest. These findings have potentially important implications for program and/or policy decisions, but estimates for MSAs with low HIV testing denominators should be interpreted with caution and verified locally before planning action.

AB  - A growing body of evidence suggests that network-based interventions to reduce HIV transmission and/or improve HIV-related health outcomes have an important place in public health efforts to move towards 90-90-90 goals. However, the social processes involved in network-based recruitment may pose a risk to participants of increasing HIV-related stigma if network recruitment causes HIV status to be assumed, inferred, or disclosed. On the other hand, the social processes involved in network-based recruitment to HIV testing may also encourage HIV-related social support. Yet despite the relevance of these processes to both network-based interventions and to other more common interventions (e.g., partner services), there is a dearth of literature that directly examines them among participants of such interventions. Furthermore, both HIV-related stigma and social support may influence participants' willingness and ability to recruit their network members to the study. This paper examines (1) the extent to which stigma and support were experienced by participants in the Transmission Reduction Intervention Project (TRIP), a risk network-tracing intervention aimed at locating recently HIV-infected and/or undiagnosed HIV-infected people and linking them to care in Athens, Greece; Odessa, Ukraine; and Chicago, Illinois; and (2) whether stigma and support predicted participant engagement in the intervention. Overall, experiences of stigma were infrequent and experiences of support frequent, with significant variation between study sites. Experiences and perceptions of HIV-related stigma did not change significantly between baseline and six-month follow-up for the full TRIP sample, and significantly decreased during the course of the study at the Chicago site. Experiences of HIV-related support significantly increased among recently-HIV-infected participants at all sites, and among all participants at the Odessa site. Both stigma and support were found to predict participants' recruitment of network members to the study at the Athens site, and to predict participants' interviewer-rated enthusiasm for naming and recruiting their network members at both the Athens and Odessa sites. These findings suggest that network-based interventions like TRIP which aim to reduce HIV transmission likely do not increase stigma-related risks to participants, and may even encourage increased social support among network members. However, the present study is limited by its associational design and by some variation in implementation by study site. Future research should directly assess contextual differences to improve understanding of the implications of site-level variation in stigma and support for the implementation of network-based interventions, given the finding that these constructs predict participants' recruitment of network members and engagement in the intervention, and thereby could limit network-based interventions' abilities to reach those most in need of HIV testing and care.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: This paper examines the extent to which an intervention succeeded in locating people who had recently become infected with HIV in the context of the large-scale Ukrainian epidemic. Locating and intervening with people who recently became infected with HIV (people with recent infection, or PwRI) can reduce forward HIV transmission and help PwRI remain healthy. METHODS: The Transmission Reduction Intervention Project (TRIP) recruited recently-infected and longer-term infected seeds in Odessa, Ukraine, in 2013 to 2016, and asked them to help recruit their extended risk network members. The proportions of network members who were PwRI were compared between TRIP arms (i.e. networks of recently-infected seeds vs. networks of longer-term infected seeds) and to the proportion of participants who were PwRI in an RDS-based Integrated Biobehavioral Surveillance of people who inject drugs in 2013. RESULTS: The networks of PwRI seeds and those of longer-term infected seeds had similar (2%) proportions who were themselves PwRI. This was higher than the 0.25% proportion in IBBS (OR = 7.80; p = 0.016). The odds ratio among the subset of participants who injected drugs was 11.17 (p = 0.003). Cost comparison analyses using simplified ingredients-based methods found that TRIP spent no more than US $4513 per PwRI located whereas IBBS spent $11,924. CONCLUSIONS: Further research is needed to confirm these results and improve TRIP further, but our findings suggest that interventions that trace the networks of people who test HIV-positive are a cost-effective way to locate PwRI and reduce HIV transmission and should therefore be implemented.

AB  - As part of a network study of HIV infection among people who inject drugs (PWID) and their contacts, we discovered a connected subcomponent of 29 uninfected PWID. In the context of a just-declining large epidemic outbreak, this raised a question: What explains the existence of large pockets of uninfected people? Possible explanations include "firewall effects" (Friedman et al., 2000; Dombrowski et al., 2017) wherein the only HIV+ people that the uninfected take risks with have low viral loads; "bottleneck effects" wherein few network paths into the pocket of non-infection exist; low levels of risk behavior; and an impending outbreak. We considered each of these. Participants provided information on their enhanced sexual and injection networks and assisted us in recruiting network members. The largest connected component had 241 members. Data on risk behaviors in the last 6 months were collected at the individual level. Recent infection was determined by LAg (Sedia(TM) Biosciences Corporation), data on recent seronegative tests, and viral load. HIV RNA was quantified using Artus HI Virus-1 RG RT-PCR (Qiagen). The 29 members of the connected subcomponent of uninfected participants were connected (network distance = 1) to 17 recently-infected and 24 long-term infected participants. Fourteen (48%) of these 29 uninfected were classified as "extremely high risk" because they self-reported syringe sharing and had at least one injection partner with viral load >100,000 copies/mL who also reported syringe sharing. Seventeen of the 29 uninfected were re-interviewed after 6 months, but none had seroconverted. These findings show the power of network research in discovering infection patterns that standard individual-level studies cannot. Theoretical development and exploratory network research studies may be needed to understand these findings and deepen our understanding of how HIV does and does not spread through communities. Finally, the methods developed here provide practical tools to study "bottleneck" and "firewall" network hypotheses in practice.

AB  - PURPOSE: The challenges of producing adequate estimates of HIV prevalence among men who have sex with men (MSM) are well known. No one, to our knowledge, has published annual estimates of HIV prevalence among MSM over an extended period and across a wide range of geographic areas. METHODS: This article applies multilevel modeling to data integrated from numerous sources to estimate and validate trajectories of HIV prevalence among MSM from 1992 to 2013 for 86 of the largest metropolitan statistical areas in the United States. RESULTS: Our estimates indicate that HIV prevalence among MSM increased, from an across-metropolitan statistical area mean of 11% in 1992 to 20% in 2013 (S.D. = 3.5%). Our estimates by racial/ethnic subgroups of MSM suggest higher mean HIV prevalence among black and Hispanic/Latino MSM than among white MSM across all years and geographic regions. CONCLUSIONS: The increases found in HIV prevalence among all MSM are likely primarily attributable to decreases in mortality and perhaps also to increasing HIV incidence among racial/ethnic minority MSM. Future research is needed to confirm this. If true, health care initiatives should focus on targeted HIV prevention efforts among racial/ethnic minority MSM and on training providers to address cross-cutting health challenges of increased longevity among HIV-positive MSM.

AB  - PURPOSE: Estimates of HIV prevalence, and how it changes over time, are needed to inform action (e.g., resource allocation) to improve HIV-related public health. However, creating adequate estimates of (diagnosed and undiagnosed) HIV prevalence is challenging due to biases in samples receiving HIV testing and due to difficulties enumerating key risk populations. To our knowledge, estimates of HIV prevalence among high risk heterosexuals in the United States produced for geographic areas smaller than the entire nation have to date been only for single years and/or for single cities (or other single geographic locations). METHODS: The present study addresses these gaps by using multilevel modeling on multiple data series, in combination with previous estimates of HIV prevalence among heterosexuals from the extant literature, to produce annual estimates of HIV prevalence among high risk heterosexuals for each of 89 metropolitan statistical areas, from 1992 to 2013. It also produces estimates for these MSAs and years by racial/ethnic subgroup to allow for an examination of change over time in racial/ethnic disparities in HIV prevalence among high risk heterosexuals. RESULTS: The resulting estimates suggest that HIV prevalence among high risk heterosexuals has decreased steadily, on average, from 1992 to 2013. Examination of these estimates by racial/ ethnic subgroup suggests that this trend is primarily due to decreases among Black and Hispanic/Latino high risk heterosexuals. HIV prevalence among white high risk heterosexuals remained steady over time at around 1% during the study period. Although HIV prevalence among Black and Hispanic/Latino high risk heterosexuals was much higher (approximately 3.5% and 3.3%, respectively) than that among whites in 1992, over time these differences decreased as HIV prevalence decreased over time among these subgroups. By 2013, HIV prevalence among Hispanic/Latino high risk heterosexuals was estimated to be very similar to that among white high risk heterosexuals (approximately 1%), with prevalence among Black high risk heterosexuals still estimated to be almost twice as high. CONCLUSIONS: It is likely that as HIV incidence has decreased among heterosexuals from 1992 to 2013, mortality due to all causes has remained disparately high among racial/ethnic minorities, thereby outpacing new HIV cases. Future research should aim to empirically examine this by comparing changes over time in estimated HIV incidence among heterosexuals to changes over time in mortality and causes of death among HIV-positive heterosexuals, by racial/ethnic subgroup.

AB  - An "urban" subfield exists in virtually every social science discipline, but these subfields seldom engage one another. We asked scholars from five urban subfields to respond to questions about the state of urban research within their discipline. This article consists of their consequent essays and reflections on their responses. The questions posed included the discipline's conception of "urban," the main concerns motivating the subfield, the primary methodologies pursued, the extent to which their subfield interacted with or was informed by research in other urban subfields, and the main concepts or approaches it had to offer to other subfields or might take away from them. In our reflections, we particularly note the intellectual and institutional difficulties in creating a broader field of urban research or of engaging in truly inter-disciplinary research. We also highlight the desirability of greater engagement across these subfields through encouraging a "republic of conversation" among them.

AB  - Private schools have long played a crucial role in male elite formation but their importance to women's trajectories is less clear. In this paper, we explore the relationship between girls' private schools and elite recruitment in Britain over the past 120 years - drawing on the historical database of Who's Who, a unique catalogue of the elite. We find that alumni of elite girls schools have been around 20 times more likely than other women to reach elite positions. They are also more likely to follow particular channels of elite recruitment, via the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, private members clubs and elite spouses. Yet such schools have also consistently been less propulsive than their male-only counterparts. We argue this is rooted in the ambivalent aims of girls elite education, where there has been a longstanding tension between promoting academic achievement and upholding traditional processes of gendered social reproduction.

AB  - Truncation of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) gp41 cytoplasmic tail (CT) can modulate the fusogenicity of the envelope glycoprotein (Env) on infected cells and virions. However, the CT domains involved and the underlying mechanism responsible for this "inside-out" regulation of Env function are unknown. HIV and SIV CTs are remarkably long and contain amphipathic alpha-helical domains (LLP1, LLP2, and LLP3) that likely interact with cellular membranes. Using a cell-cell fusion assay and a panel of HIV Envs with stop codons at various positions in the CT, we show that truncations of gp41 proximal to the most N-terminal alpha helix, LLP2, increase fusion efficiency and expose CD4-induced epitopes in the Env ectodomain. These effects were not seen with a truncation distal to this domain and before LLP1. Using a dye transfer assay to quantitate fusion kinetics, we found that these truncations produced a two- to fourfold increase in the rate of fusion. These results were observed for X4-, R5-, and dual-tropic Envs on CXCR4- and CCR5-expressing target cells and could not be explained by differences in Env surface expression. These findings suggest that distal to the membrane-spanning domain, an interaction of the gp41 LLP2 domain with the cell membrane restricts Env fusogenicity during Env processing. As with murine leukemia viruses, where cleavage of a membrane-interactive R peptide at the C terminus is required for Env to become fusogenic, this restriction of Env function may serve to protect virus-producing cells from the membrane-disruptive effects of the Env ectodomain.

AB  - To identify a CCR5 antagonist as an HIV-1 entry inhibitor, we designed a novel series of indane derivatives based on conformational considerations. Modification on the indane ring led to the discovery of compound 22a (INCB9471) that exhibited high affinity for CCR5, potent anti-HIV-1 activity, high receptor selectivity, excellent oral bioavailability, and a tolerated safety profile. INCB9471 has entered human clinical trials.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Due to practical challenges associated with genetic sequencing in low-resource environments, the burden of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in forcibly displaced people is understudied. We examined the use of field applicable HCV sequencing methods and phylogenetic analysis to determine HCV transmission dynamics in internally displaced people who inject drugs (IDPWID) in Ukraine. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we used modified respondent-driven sampling to recruit IDPWID who were displaced to Odesa, Ukraine, before 2020. We generated partial and near full length genome (NFLG) HCV sequences using Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) MinION in a simulated field environment. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods were used to establish phylodynamic relationships. RESULTS: Between June and September 2020, we collected epidemiological data and whole blood samples from 164 IDPWID (PNAS Nexus.2023;2(3):pgad008). Rapid testing (Wondfo® One Step HCV; Wondfo® One Step HIV1/2) identified an anti-HCV seroprevalence of 67.7%, and 31.1% of participants tested positive for both anti-HCV and HIV. We generated 57 partial or NFLG HCV sequences and identified eight transmission clusters, of which at least two originated within a year and a half post-displacement. CONCLUSIONS: Locally generated genomic data and phylogenetic analysis in rapidly changing low-resource environments, such as those faced by forcibly displaced people, can help inform effective public health strategies. For example, evidence of HCV transmission clusters originating soon after displacement highlights the importance of implementing urgent preventive interventions in ongoing situations of forced displacement.

AB  - When intracisternally injected to rat brain, aluminum induced apoptosis as assessed by DNA fragmentation and activation of caspase-3 and caspase-12. Co-administration of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) effectively prevented aluminum-induced cell death through reduced apoptosis whereas brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) accelerated aluminum-induced apoptosis, suggesting that the extent of aluminum neurotoxicity in vivo may depend on the biological activity of the neurotrophic factors.

AB  - Antigen-presenting cells (APCs) act as vehicles that transfer HIV to their target CD4(+) cells through an intercellular junction, termed the virologic synapse. The molecules that are involved in this process remain largely unidentified. In this study, we used photoaffinity labeling and a proteomic approach to identify new proteins that facilitate HIV-1 transfer. We identified ectopic mitochondrial ATP synthase as a factor that mediates HIV-1 transfer between APCs and CD4(+) target cells. Monoclonal antibodies against the β-subunit of ATP synthase inhibited APC-mediated transfer of multiple strains HIV-1 to CD4(+) target cells. Likewise, the specific inhibitors of ATPase, citreoviridin and IF1, completely blocked APC-mediated transfer of HIV-1 at the APC-target cell interaction step. Confocal fluorescent microscopy showed localization of extracellular ATP synthase at junctions between APC and CD4(+) target cells. We conclude that ectopic ATP synthase could be an accessible molecular target for inhibiting HIV-1 proliferation in vivo.

AB  - HIV prevention programs often focus on the physical social venues where men who have sex with men (MSM) frequent as sites where sex behaviors are assumed to be practiced and risk is conferred. But, how exactly these behaviors influence venue patronage is not well understood. In this study, we present a two-mode network analysis that determines the extent that three types of sex behaviors-condomless sex, sex-drug use, and group sex-influence the patronage of different types of social venues among a population sample of young Black MSM (YBMSM) (N = 623). A network analytic technique called exponential random graph modeling was used in a proof of concept analysis to verify how each sex behavior increases the likelihood of a venue patronage tie when estimated as either: (1) an attribute of an individual only and/or (2) a shared attribute between an individual and his peers. Findings reveal that sex behaviors, when modeled only as attributes possessed by focal individuals, were no more or less likely to affect choices to visit social venues. However, when the sex behaviors of peers were also taken into consideration, we learn that individuals were statistically more likely in all three behavioral conditions to go places that attracted other MSM who practiced the same behaviors. This demonstrates that social venues can function as intermediary contexts in which relationships can form between individuals that have greater risk potential given the venues attraction to people who share the same risk tendencies. As such, structuring interventions around these settings can be an effective way to capture the attention of YBMSM and engage them in HIV prevention.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Advances in biomedical prevention strategies such as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) represent a new opportunity for reducing HIV incidence among young Black men who have sex with men, for whom the number of new HIV infections continues to rise. However, studies have documented low rates of PrEP uptake in this community. Research suggests that the peer networks of young Black men who have sex with men play important roles in their sexual health decisions. PrEP Chicago is a randomized controlled trial network intervention designed to increase PrEP uptake among young Black men who have sex with men living in Chicago. The aims of this study are twofold. Aim 1 is to estimate the effectiveness of a peer change agent intervention for (1) increasing the number of referrals made to a PrEP information line, (2) increasing the rate of PrEP adoption among non-participant peers, and (3) increasing PrEP knowledge, attitudes, and intentions among participants. Aim 2 is to determine the individual and network variables that explain peer change agent effectiveness. METHODS: PrEP Chicago is a social network intervention that utilizes the influence of peer change agents to link young Black men who have sex with men in Chicago to PrEP. Young Black men who have sex with men were recruited using respondent-driven sampling. Once screened for eligibility, participants were randomly assigned to either one of two treatment sequences: (1) intervention treatment in Year 1 followed by a minimal contact attention control in Year 2 or (2) the minimal contact attention control in Year 1 followed by treatment in Year 2. The treatment consists of a PrEP/peer change agent training workshop followed by booster calls for 12 months. The attention control consists of a sex diary activity designed to help participants assess sexual risk. Psychosocial, sexual health, and network data are collected from all participants at baseline and at 12- and 24-month follow-ups. RESULTS: In total, 423 participants aged 18-35 have been enrolled (more than 100% target enrollment) and have completed baseline data collection. A majority of participants in both intervention and control groups reported having heard of PrEP before enrolling in the study, yet also reported having had no current or prior experience taking PrEP. Statistical analyses await completion of Year 1 of the trial in March 2018. CONCLUSION: PrEP Chicago addresses a gap in HIV prevention research and intervention design by utilizing the existing social networks among young Black men who have sex with men as mechanisms for information diffusion, behavioral influence, social support, and empowerment. Therefore, interventions that leverage peer influence processes to facilitate PrEP uptake are promising strategies to improve sexual health engagement and overcome disparities in outcomes among this at-risk population.

AB  - HIV risk and infection are markedly increased among sexual minority women injectors compared to other injecting drug users. Our ethnographic exploration of this well-documented but poorly understood phenomenon included 270 interviews and over 350 field observations with 65 sexual minority women injectors in New York City and Boston. We discuss findings in relation to four preliminary hypotheses. Neither the presence of gay or bisexual men in risk networks, nor a sense of invulnerability due to lesbian (or other sexual minority) identity seem to be plausible explanations of increased HIV among sexual minority women injectors. However, multiple marginalization was found to be pervasive and to have severe consequences that can be traced to increased HIV risk for many women in the study.

AB  - This article is a comprehensive review of published research on HIV seroprevalence and HIV-related risk behaviors among women injection drug users (IDUs) who have sex with women (WSW). At least 14 studies since the late 1980s converge into a consistent pattern. compared to other IDUs, WSW IDUs report higher levels of HIV-related risk behaviors and in many cases exhibit higher rates of HIV seroconversion or seroprevalence. Data from these and additional studies also indicate that large numbers of women IDUs are WSWs. Since information regarding WSW IDUs are widely collected but infrequently analyzed and reported, we suggest promising research and analysis strategies for exploring the meaning behind this pattern of increased vulnerability to HIV. Finally, we assert that enough is currently known to warrant significant investment in targeted prevention and intervention programs to address the critical HIV-related needs of lesbian, bisexual, and other WSW IDUs.

AB  - A strategy to produce sufficient anticoagulant properties with reduced risk of bleeding may be possible through inhibition of factor XI (FXI), a component of the intrinsic coagulation cascade. The objective of this work was to determine the safety profile of ISIS 416858, a 2'-methoxyethoxy (2'-MOE) antisense oligonucleotide inhibitor of FXI, with focus on assessment of bleeding risk. Cynomolgus monkeys administered ISIS 416858 (4, 8, 12, and 40 mg/kg/wk, subcutaneous) for up to 13 weeks produced a dose-dependent reduction in FXI (mRNA in liver and plasma activity) and a concomitant increase in activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT). ISIS 416858 (20 or 40 mg/kg/wk) reduced plasma FXI activity by 80% at 4 weeks of treatment that resulted in a 33% increase in APTT by 13 weeks with no effects on PT, platelets, or increased bleeding following partial tail amputation or gum and skin laceration. The dose-dependent presence of basophilic granules in multiple tissues in ISIS 416858-treated animals was an expected histologic change for a 2'-MOE antisense oligonucleotide, and no toxicity was attributed to hepatic FXI reduction. Basophilic granules reflect cellular drug uptake and subsequent visualization on hematoxylin staining. These results suggest that ISIS 416858 has an acceptable preclinical safety profile and is a promising clinical candidate to treat thrombotic disease.

AB  - Background/Aims: Multidrug resistance proteins (MDRs, including P-glycoproteins) are efflux pumps that serve important biological functions but hinder successful drug delivery to the CNS. Many chemotherapeutic agents, anti-epileptics, anti-HIV drugs, and opiates are substrates for MDRs. Therefore, understanding the regulation of MDRs in the endothelial cells composing the blood-brain barrier has therapeutic implications. Methods: We used microarray, real time RT-PCR, Western blotting, and uptake of vinblastine by RBE4 cerebral endothelial cells to test the effects of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) on the expression and functions of Pglycoprotein (MDR1). Results: The proinflammatory cytokine TNF specifically induced the expression and enhanced the function of MDR1 in RBE4 cells. The persistent upregulation of MDR1 mRNA was shown by cDNA microarray at 6, 12, and 24 h after TNF treatment. This was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR between 2 and 24 h. MDR1 protein expression was increased 6 to 24 h after TNF treatment and resulted in a significant reduction in the cellular uptake of H-3-vinblastine. Conclusion: The drug efflux transporter in cerebral endothelial cells can be upregulated by TNF. This suggests that adjunctive anti-TNF treatment has novel therapeutic potential in conditions such as brain cancer, epilepsy, neuroAIDS, and chronic pain. Copyright (c) 2007 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - Following the development of networking and mobile devices, the technology of managing the offline information online is being conducted widely. Also, as the social services have become much more active, users are registering and managing their personal information on online websites and sharing it with other users to acquire the information they need. For modern people living in a smart city, the planning of smarter services is required. The convergence of ET and IT or advanced scientific technologies such as AI or Big Data is often mentioned whenever the smart city is discussed. Nevertheless, smart services that could introduce smart solutions to conventional industries or change existing lifestyles should also be considered. Therefore, this paper discusses a service related to the convergence of the traditional clothing industry with IT and a service wherein CT is converged with systems that allow customers to participate in the design work and share the designs they have created. In other words, this study is a case study of CT and IT services in the clothing industry and is inclusive of an apparel shopping mall service that encourages customer participation in design, a customer-oriented editing user interface, and a copyright management system. The results show that both production method and production capacity largely affect the user interface of apparel platform services, with customer freedom significantly correlated with their functional roles. Moreover, the lead index is shown to be one of the factors restraining customer freedom. With this analysis, an apparel shopping mall wherein customers participate in the design work has been developed especially for clothes with more complex designs. The shopping mall emphasizes functionality from the perspective of customer use. At the same time, an online environment for an apparel service appropriate for the smart city has been implemented.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Despite their effectiveness in preventing the transmission of HIV among people who inject drugs (PWID), syringe services programs (SSPs) in many settings are hampered by social and political opposition. We aimed to estimate the impact of closure and temporary interruption of SSP on the HIV epidemic in a rural United States setting. METHODS: Using an agent-based model (ABM) calibrated to observed surveillance data, we simulated HIV risk behaviors and transmission in adult populations who inject and do not inject drugs in Scott County, Indiana. We projected HIV incidence and prevalence between 2020 and 2025 for scenarios with permanent closure, delayed closure (one additional renewal for 24 months before closure), and temporary closure (lasting 12 months) of an SSP in comparison to persistent SSP operation. RESULTS: With sustained SSP operation, we projected an incidence rate of 0.15 per 100 person-years among the overall population (95% simulation interval: 0.06-0.28). Permanently closing the SSP would cause an average of 58.4% increase in the overall incidence rate during 2021-2025, resulting in a higher prevalence of 60.8% (50.9-70.6%) (18.7% increase) among PWID by 2025. A delayed closure would increase the incidence rate by 38.9%. A temporary closure would cause 12 (35.3%) more infections during 2020-2021. CONCLUSION: Our analysis suggests that temporary interruption and permanent closure of existing SSPs operating in rural United States may lead to 'rebound' HIV outbreaks among PWID. To reach and sustain HIV epidemic control, it will be necessary to maintain existing and implement new SSPs in combination with other prevention interventions.

AB  - PURPOSE: Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) medications for intraocular use are a major and increasing cost, and biosimilars may be a means of reducing the high cost of many biologic medications. However, a bevacizumab biosimilar, which is currently pending Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval (bevacizumab-vikg), paradoxically may increase the cost burden of intravitreal anti-VEGF agents, because off-label repackaged drugs may no longer be allowed per the Drug Quality and Security Act (DQSA). We aimed to investigate the potential impact of biosimilars on costs in the United States. DESIGN: Cost analysis of anti-VEGF medications. PARTICIPANTS: Medicare data from October 2022 and previously published market share data from 2019. METHODS: Average sales prices (ASPs) of ranibizumab, aflibercept, and bevacizumab were calculated from Medicare allowable payments. The ASPs of biosimilars were calculated from wholesale acquisition costs from a representative distributor. The cost of an intraocular bevacizumab formulation is modeled at $500/1.25-mg dose and $900/1.25-mg dose. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs of anti-VEGF drugs to Medicare Part B and patients. RESULTS: If an intraocular bevacizumab biosimilar were to be priced at $500, costs to Medicare would increase by $457 million from $3.01 billion to $3.47 billion (15.2% increase). Patient responsibility would increase by $117 million from $768 million to $884 million. Similarly, if intraocular bevacizumab were priced at $900, Medicare costs would increase by $897 million to $3.91 billion (29.8% increase), and patient responsibility would increase by $229 million to $997 million. If bevacizumab were $500/dose, switching all patients currently receiving ranibizumab or aflibercept to respective biosimilars would compensate for only 28.8% of the increased cost. Current prices of ranibizumab and aflibercept biosimilars would have to decrease by an aggregate of 15.7% to $616.80/injection, $1027.97/injection, and $1436.88/injection for ranibizumab 0.3 mg, ranibizumab 0.5 mg, and aflibercept, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: An FDA-approved bevacizumab biosimilar for ophthalmic use could increase costs to the health care system and patients, raising concerns for access. This increase would not be offset by ranibizumab and aflibercept biosimilar use at current prices. These data support the need for an exemption of section 503B of the DQSA and continued use of repackaged off-label bevacizumab.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Regular methamphetamine (MA) use can result in withdrawal syndrome characterized by fatigue, agitation, depression, and anxiety. No studies that we are aware of have examined the prevalence and predictors of MA withdrawal symptoms among people who inject drugs (PWID). METHODS: PWID were recruited using targeted sampling methods in Los Angeles and San Francisco, California from 2016 to 2017. Survey questions included demographics, drug use, and MA withdrawal symptoms, frequency, and symptom severity. Participants who reported regular MA use (> 12 times in the last 30 days) were included in this analysis (N = 595). Multivariable regression models were developed to examine factors associated with any MA withdrawal, withdrawal frequency, symptom severity, and receptive syringe sharing. RESULTS: MA withdrawal symptoms in the past 6 months were reported by 53 % of PWID, with 25 % reporting weekly withdrawal symptoms, and 20 % reporting very or extremely painful symptoms. In multivariable logistic regression, presence of any MA withdrawal symptoms was positively associated with more frequent MA use and non-injection tranquilizer use and inversely associated with crack cocaine use. Among those reporting any withdrawal, female sex was associated with more frequent withdrawal symptoms. Very or extremely painful withdrawal symptoms were associated with being in residential treatment. Receptive syringe sharing was associated with any MA withdrawal symptoms and weekly frequency of symptoms. CONCLUSION: MA withdrawal symptoms are common among PWID and are associated with receptive syringe sharing. Strategies for implementing MA use treatment, safe supply programs, and syringe services programs targeting people who inject MA are indicated.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the effects of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and platelet-enriched fibrin glue on bone formation in bone tissue engineering. STUDY DESIGN: PRP was mixed with bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2), and the composites were injected into the subcutaneous space on the dorsum of nude mice. On the contralateral side of the dorsum, platelet-enriched fibrin glue/bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells/BMP-2 composites were injected. Bone formation was evaluated after 12 weeks. RESULTS: The volumes of subcutaneous nodules formed in nude mice were 55 +/- 18 microL at the PRP/bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells/BMP-2 sites and 135 +/- 27 microL at the platelet-enriched fibrin glue/bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells/BMP-2 sites. Histomorphometric analysis demonstrated that the nodules contained 14.9 +/- 4.1% newly formed bone when using PRP and 19.8 +/- 3.6% newly formed bone when using platelet-enriched fibrin glue. CONCLUSION: The results indicated that the osteogenic characteristics of platelet-enriched fibrin glue are superior to PRP in bone tissue engineering.

AB  - Blood specimens from 165 intravenous drug users who were seropositive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), from 158 seropositive homosexual men with lymphadenopathy, and from 77 patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) were assessed immunologically. Immunologic parameters were analyzed by the Guttman scalogram technique to determine if immunologic abnormalities occurred in a nonrandom pattern. The following four patterns emerged: (i) seropositivity for HIV with no immunologic abnormalities; (ii) seropositivity for HIV with a depressed T4/T8 cell ratio; (iii) seropositivity with a depressed T4/T8 cell ratio and T4-cell depletion; and (iv) seropositivity with a depressed T4/T8 cell ratio, T4-cell depletion, and lymphopenia. Ninety-two to 100% of subjects in each of the three groups of patients were found "to scale" because the abnormalities occurred in the cumulative, ordered fashion described. This nonrandom occurrence of abnormalities indicates an ordered progression of immunologic abnormalities in individuals infected with HIV, a finding useful in the staging of both symptomatic and asymptomatic HIV-seropositive subjects.

AB  - BACKGROUND: When shared by people who inject drugs, needles and syringes with different dead space may affect the probability of HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) transmission differently. METHODS: We measured dead space in 56 needle and syringe combinations obtained from needle and syringe programs across 17 countries in Europe and Asia. We also calculated the amounts of blood and HIV that would remain in different combinations following injection and rinsing. RESULTS: Syringe barrel capacities ranged from 0.5 to 20 mL. Needles ranged in length from 8 to 38 mm. The average dead space was 3 μL in low dead space syringes with permanently attached needles, 13 μL in high dead space syringes with low dead space needles, 45 μL in low dead space syringes with high dead space needles, and 99 μL in high dead space syringes with high dead space needles. Among low dead space designs, calculated volumes of blood and HIV viral burden were lowest for low dead space syringes with permanently attached needles and highest for low dead space syringes with high dead space needles. CONCLUSION: The dead space in different low dead space needle and syringe combinations varied substantially. To reduce HIV transmission related to syringe sharing, needle and syringe programs need to combine this knowledge with the needs of their clients.
